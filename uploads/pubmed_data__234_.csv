"Changes in erythrocyte 2,3 diphosphoglycerate in women following short term maximal exercise.",Dec 1975,"15 untrained women were subjected to a walking treadmill test to determine the influence of maximal exercise upon synthesis of erythrocyte 2,3 DPG. Although there was a 9.8% increase in the 2,3 DPG content following exercise, there was a concomitant 9.4% increase in the hemoglobin level; therefore, when 2,3 DPG is expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin (See Article), there was no significant change as a result of exercise stress. It was suggested that three additive factors produced during strenuous exercise; decreased pH; increased hemoglobin concentration; and increased CO2 production result in by-product inhibition of 2,3 DPG synthesis. It is concluded that 2,3 DPG does not provide a physiologic benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise.","Bonner, H W; Tate, C A; Buffington, C K",European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology,0301-5548,10.1007/BF00999936,234,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/234,
