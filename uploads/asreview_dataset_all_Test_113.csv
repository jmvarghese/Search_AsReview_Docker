47,Tralokinumab in atopic dermatitis.,Oct-21,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and intense pruritus, and it can have marked negative impact on those affected. Pathophysiologically, AD is complex with genetic predisposition and environmental provocation being important contributors. Mechanistically these can promote epidermal barrier dysfunction, skin microbiome abnormalities and a skewed immune response which is predominantly type-2 immunity-based. Our increased understanding of the immunological processes involved highlight a key role for interleukin-13 (IL-13). This mini-review evaluates tralokinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits IL-13. Based on dose-finding study results, tralokinumab 300 mg every two weeks (Q2W) subcutaneously (SC) was investigated in three pivotal phase III clinical trials in adults with moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled on topical corticosteroids alone. Tralokinumab was significantly superior to placebo regarding the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0/1 and EASI-75 at week 16 (primary endpoints), as well as improving scores for worst daily pruritus, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) (secondary endpoints). The week 16 response was sustained during follow-up, and treatment with tralokinumab was found to be well-tolerated with an overall frequency and severity of adverse events comparable to placebo.","Wollenberg, Andreas; Weidinger, Stephan; Worm, Margitta; Bieber, Thomas",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,1610-0387,10.1111/ddg.14545,34390128,"Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Munich, Germany.; Department of Dermatology and Allergy, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.; Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergy, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Dermatology and Allergy, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34390128,1,0,,6

69,"Efficacy of Dupilumab in Different Racial Subgroups of Adults With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis in Three Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Trials.",Aug-19,"Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor subunit for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, is currently approved for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The efficacy and safety of dupilumab for AD among racial subgroups is unknown. This post hoc analysis from three phase 3 trials assessed the efficacy and safety of dupilumab vs placebo by racial subgroup (White, Asian, Black/African American). Data from LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 (NCT02277743), SOLO 2 (NCT02277769), and CHRONOS (NCT02260986) were pooled. Outcomes included mean and percent change from baseline to week 16 in the key therapeutic domains Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, as well as Investigator’s Global Assessment and pain or discomfort assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 3 level questionnaire. A total of 2,058 patients (White n=1,429, Asian n=501, Black/African American n=128) were included in the current analysis. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment groups and racial subgroups. In the three trials, dupilumab significantly (P<0.0001) improved all assessed outcomes compared with placebo in the White and Asian subgroups. In the smaller Black/African American subgroup, dupilumab significantly (P<0.0001) improved EASI endpoints and mean changes in Peak Pruritus NRS and DLQI vs placebo, with positive numeric trends favoring dupilumab in all other endpoints. Dupilumab was generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile in all racial subgroups. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently with placebo; treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were rare in all treatment groups. Significant clinical improvement and a favorable benefit-risk profile can be achieved with dupilumab treatment in patients of White, Asian, and Black/African American racial subgroups with moderate-to-severe AD inadequately controlled with topical medications.

We performed a retrospective study including 165 adult patients affected by moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) and treated with dupilumab for at least 52 weeks. A significant improvement in eczema area severity index (EASI) score after 16 and 52 weeks of treatment with dupilumab was observed. The mean EASI score at baseline was 28.84 ± 6.4 and significantly reduced to 10.05 ± 8.00 at 16 weeks (p < 0.001), and to 3.04 ± 4.73 at 52 weeks (p < 0.001), with a mean percentage reduction of 65.15% and 89.45%, respectively. Efficacy of dupilumab was demonstrated by a significant reduction of all the scores (P-NRS, S-NRS and DLQI). Furthermore, no patient discontinued the drug because of inefficacy. Fifty-seven out of 165 (34.54%) patients reported at least one adverse event (AE) during the 52-week treatment. Our study confirms that dupilumab can represent a long-term treatment for moderate-to-severe adult AD, beyond 16 weeks.

Our objectives were to analyze the PKs and exposure-efficacy of dupilumab in adults with AD and compare the results of Japanese and overall populations. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned to dupilumab (300 mg weekly [qw] or every 2 weeks [q2w], 200 mg q2w, 300 mg every 4 weeks [q4w], or 100 mg q4w) or placebo for 16 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase IIb trial (NCT01859988). This analysis included 379 patients (58 Japanese). Functional dupilumab concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner; at lower concentrations, increases were greater than dose-proportional because of nonlinear, target-mediated clearance. Dupilumab pharmacokinetics were comparable in Japanese and non-Japanese patients with similar body weights. Week 16 efficacy parameters, including Investigator's Global Assessment score 0/1, greater than or equal to 75% reduction from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), and percentage change from baseline in EASI and pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, generally increased with week 16 trough concentration; the plateau of these exposure-efficacy relationships occurred for most patients at exposures associated with the 300 mg q2w and 300 mg qw regimens. Japanese ethnicity did not remain in the population PK model as covariate with or without accounting for body weight differences. In Japanese and non-Japanese patients, efficacy responses increased with week 16 dupilumab trough concentrations in a similar manner.

37,Therapeutic Potential of Tralokinumab in the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis: A Review on the Emerging Clinical Data.,2022,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that greatly impacts patient quality of life. Type 2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-13 is integral to the pathogenesis of AD. Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets IL-13, preventing downstream signaling of inflammatory pathways that may contribute to AD. Tralokinumab was US Food and Drug administration (FDA) recently approved for the treatment of moderate to severe AD on December 28, 2021. In our review, we will explore the efficacy and adverse effects (AEs) of tralokinumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD. A PubMed search for key articles on the emerging clinical data of tralokinumab was performed. Six randomized controlled trials of tralokinumab identified improvements in disease severity measures, including Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores and Eczema Area Severity Index 75 (EASI75) scores. Four of these studies demonstrated improvements in quality of life measures with tralokinumab, including pruritus scores, sleep interference scores, Dermatology Life Quality Index, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure, and The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36v2) scores. One study identified a similar immune response in patients taking tralokinumab to those taking the Tdap and meningococcal vaccines. Upper respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, and headaches were the most common adverse events. The varying criteria to assess changes in AD disease severity across different studies is a limitation of this review. Tralokinumab is another promising biologic option for the treatment of moderate to severe AD, which may reduce disease burden and improve patient quality of life.","Kelly, Katherine A; Perche, Patrick O; Feldman, Steven R","Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology",1178-7015,10.2147/CCID.S267217,35685998,"Center for Dermatology Research, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.; Center for Dermatology Research, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.; Center for Dermatology Research, Department of Dermatology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.; Department of Pathology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.; Department of Social Sciences & Health Policy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.; Department of Dermatology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35685998,0,0,,37

76,Dupilumab: A review of its use in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.,Mar-18,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, pruritic immune-mediated inflammatory dermatosis characterized by a T helper 2 (Th2) immune response phenotype and may be associated with systemic inflammation. Dupilumab is an interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor α-antagonist that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through blockade of the shared IL-4α subunit. Blockade of IL-4/13 is effective in reducing Th2 response. Dupilumab has recently been approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Clinical trials have shown that adults with moderate-to-severe AD who receive weekly or biweekly dupilumab injections have significantly improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including Eczema Area Severity Index, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and itch Numeric Rating Scale scores. Concomitant use of topical corticosteroids along with dupilumab results in a greater improvement in signs and symptoms of AD than with use of dupilumab alone. Biomarker analyses show that dupilumab modulates the AD molecular signature and other Th2-associated biomarkers. Common adverse events reported in the clinical trials were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reactions, skin infections, and conjunctivitis. These were mild-to-moderate in nature, and overall rates of adverse events occurred with similar frequency between the treatment and placebo groups. There were no significant serious safety concerns identified in phase III clinical trials. Dupilumab, as monotherapy or with concomitant use of topical corticosteroids, can significantly improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe AD. Ongoing studies of dupilumab will help determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of its long-term use.","Gooderham, Melinda J; Hong, H Chih-Ho; Eshtiaghi, Panteha; Papp, Kim A",Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,1097-6787,10.1016/j.jaad.2017.12.022,29471919,"Skin Centre for Dermatology, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada; Probity Medical Research, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada; Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

The relationships between upadacitinib plasma exposure and efficacy (assessed as Eczema Area Severity Index [EASI]-75, EASI-90, and Investigator Global Assessment [IGA] 0/1) in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were characterized using the data from 167 subjects who were enrolled in a phase 2b dose-ranging study. Subjects were randomized to receive once daily doses of monotherapy treatment with upadacitinib extended-release 7.5, 15, or 30 mg or placebo for 16 weeks. Logistic regression models were developed and utilized to simulate efficacy for upadacitinib with an approximate phase 3 sample size.

26,Treatment With Dupilumab in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2022,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a type 2 chronic skin disorder associated with systemic and psychosocial comorbidities decreasing the quality of life for many patients. Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukins IL-4 and IL-13, is a recently added systematic treatment option with an emerging evidence base. Here, we assessed the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients with AD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of dupilumab on AD-related outcomes including clinical symptoms, quality of life and adverse events (AE). Subgroup analysis was further performed in adults and children/adolescents. Fourteen trials were included: twelve in adults (n = 3,817) and two in children/adolescents (n = 618). Dupilumab decreased the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.98; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = (-1.09, -0.88)], the percent change difference in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) [mean difference (MD) = -31.56, 95% CI = (-33.75, -29.36)], and in pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (pNRS) [MD = -29.24, 95% CI = (-32.11, -26.37)]. It also achieved a reduction of at least ≥75% in the EASI score [Risk Ratio (RR) = 2.89, 95% CI = (2.47, 3.38)], the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≤1 [RR = 3.47, 95% CI = (2.96, 4.06)] and eight additional endpoints with no signs of increased AE compared to placebo. In subgroup analysis, the results were concordant for both groups.

3,Switching between JAK Inhibitors in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis: Unanswered Questions in Daily Clinical Practice.,Dec-23,"Data on switching between agents in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are scarce (1-3). We report the case of a patient with severe AD and inadequate response to upadacitinib who showed a complete response after switching to abrocitinib. A 23-year-old male patient with severe AD was enrolled in the Measure Up double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomized clinical trial. At baseline, the Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) was 50.6, the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) was 4, the affected Body Surface Area (BSA) was 80%, and the Worst Pruritus-Numeric Rating Scale (WP-NRS) was 10/10 (Figure 1). At week 124, the patient discontinued participation in the trial, while EASI was 9.2, IGA 3, BSA 20%, and WP-NRS 5/10 at the time. After one month off treatment, and while expecting unblinding, the patient again presented with exacerbation of AD, since EASI was 45.6, IGA 4, BSA 80%, and WP-NRS 10/10. At that point of time, access to both dupilumab and tralokinumab was not available in Greece, while upadacitinib was avoided due to inadequate patient satisfaction, partly due to recurrent ocular herpes simplex infections during the previous upadacitinib treatment. The patient was prescribed abrocitinib 200 mg daily. One month after initiation of therapy, the patient achieved complete control of the disease (EASI 0.0, IGA 0, BSA 0%, and WP-NRS 0/10) (Figure 2). This has been maintained with no reported adverse events after 12 months of continuous treatment. After unblinding, the patient was confirmed to have received 15 mg of upadacitinib daily during his participation in the clinical trial. When to switch agents in the treatment of patients with severe AD if the response is not adequate, and what agent to switch to, is an issue that is not clearly defined. Data available from the JADE EXTEND study concluded that patients failing to achieve efficacy outcomes with dupilumab can benefit from switching to both doses of abrocitinib (1). However, a number of patients in this study did not achieve efficacy outcomes even after treatment with 200 mg of abrocitinib. Furthermore, sub-population analysis of the JADE EXTEND study, evaluating difficult-to-achieve patient-oriented outcomes such as Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) ≤2 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) ≤1, further emphasized that switching might be beneficial for a significant number of patients, but unmet need was still evident for some of them (4). The literature lacks data on switching between Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in AD. Treat-to-target might be different for early control of the disease, as baricitinib and upadacitinib were assessed at 16 weeks, while abrocitinib was assessed at 12 weeks in the pivotal studies. Regarding the present case, the different clinical response obtained cannot be clearly defined since abrocitinib and upadacitinib are both selective JAK1 inhibitors. Consequently, the targeted inflammatory pathways and the expected regulation of immune functionality could be similar. We may assume that the high dose of abrocitinib vs. the low dose of upadacitinib could have accounted for the improved response. However, it is impossible to assess whether clinical outcomes would have been comparable with the administration of the full dose of upadacitinib 30 mg daily or whether usage of a half-dose of abrocitinib 100 mg daily would have also resulted in inadequate response in the same patient. Switching within the same class of treatment agents has also been a heavily-debated issue for psoriasis for many years; however, recent data suggest that switching between interleukin (IL)-17A antagonists may be of benefit to some patients, although the underlying mechanism of action is still under investigation (5,6). Treatment modification in inadequate response could include: up-dosing, adding classical treatments like methotrexate to the JAK inhibitor, switching to monoclonals, or switching to another JAK inhibitor, taking into account published metanalyses of the efficacy of novel agents. Consequently, there is an unmet need to determine an algorithmic step-by-step approach of treat-to-target and switching or adding treatment in the current landscape of AD therapy. Different policies of reimbursement in different countries, along with a lack of comparative studies, may complicate adding such recommendations to existing treatment guidelines.","Mastraftsi, Styliani; Bakakis, Michail; Tsiogka, Aikaterini; Afroditi Kleidona, Ileana; Gregoriou, Stamatios",Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,1847-6538,,38439732,"Styliani Mastraftsi, MD, 5, Ionos Dragoumi str., 16121, Athens, Greece; stmastraftsi@yahoo.com.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38439732,0,0,,62
25,Dupilumab dose spacing after initial successful treatment or adverse events in adult patients with atopic dermatitis: A retrospective analysis.,Dec-22,"Strategies on long-term management of patients affected by atopic dermatitis (AD) undergoing treatment with dupilumab achieving good clinical response (GCR) or experiencing dupilumab-related adverse events (AEs) are scant. Data of patients who implemented longer than scheduled dupilumab dosing interval due to GCR (at least 52 weeks of treatment and controlled AD activity [Eczema Area Severity Index ≤7 and Dermatology Life Quality Index ≤5 for at least 6 months]) or AEs (dupilumab-related and treatment-resistant conjunctivitis) were retrospectively collected. Dupilumab was tapered to Q3W or Q4W based on physician-patient shared decision. At baseline (T0) and each follow-up (week 16 [T1] and week 32 [T2]) disease severity was assessed. A total of 59 patients implemented longer than scheduled dosing interval (44 GCR, 15 AEs). Among these, 50 (35 GCR and 15 conjunctivitis) patients switched to 300 mg Q3W, while nine GCR subjects to Q4W. In the GCR group Q3W, 34 and 31 patients maintained clinical response at T1 and T2, whereas eight and seven Q4W subjects maintained clinical response at the same timepoints, respectively. No significant differences in AD severity were observed between T1 and T2 in both groups. Contrariwise, one Q3W and one Q4W patients at T1, and three Q3W and one Q4W subjects at T2, returned to dupilumab labeled dosage due to AD worsening. In conjunctivitis group, dupilumab Q3W was maintained in eight and four patients at T1 and T2, respectively. Three patients at T1 and three at T2 subjects returned to the labeled interval due to conjunctivitis remission. Four patients at T1 and four subjects at T2 interrupted dupilumab due to the persistence of conjunctivitis. A longer dupilumab dosing interval may be a valuable option in patients with a GCR and may be a useful strategy to reduce treatment-related conjunctivitis, also with pharmacoeconomic benefit.","Patruno, Cataldo; Potestio, Luca; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Napolitano, Maddalena",Dermatologic therapy,1529-8019,10.1111/dth.15933,36227462,"Department of Health Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.; Section of Dermatology - Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.; Section of Dermatology - Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Health Sciences Vincenzo Tiberio, University of Molise, Campobasso, Italy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227462,0,0,,63

It focuses on epidemiology, disease processes and methodological issues. There is reasonable evidence to conclude that high birth weight (> 4000 g) is a risk factor for the development of AE. A lower socioeconomic position is associated with lower prevalence of AE. The effect of exposure to traffic-related air pollution in childhood on the development of AE is uncertain. CD14 polymorphisms do not appear to have an effect in AE. There may be a role for interleukin-18 in AE development. Patients with AE are at decreased risk of brain tumours, but at increased risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Evidence supports the view that normal-appearing skin in AE is in fact structurally abnormal. Lower success rates at inducing remission in AE are associated with increased risk of relapse during long-term follow-up. The Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) has been agreed as the preferred core instrument to measure clinical signs in future research. There remains a lack of consensus on the definition of an AE flare.","Hatfield, S J; Rogers, N K; Lloyd-Lavery, A; Grindlay, D; Barnett, R; Thomas, K S",Clinical and experimental dermatology,1365-2230,10.1111/ced.12977,27805275,"Dermatology Department, St Luke's Hospital, Bradford, UK.; Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.; Department of Dermatology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK.; Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.; Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.; Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27805275,0,0,,74

Data were collected at baseline (n = 120) and at follow-up at 6 months (range 3-9 months, n = 59), and 12 months (10 months or later, n = 36). Depression was assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale-Self-report (MADRS-S) and AD with the Eczema Area Severity Index, the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, the Dermatology Life Quality Index and evaluation of pruritus. More than half of patients with moderate-to-severe AD had depressive symptoms at baseline, 24% presented with moderate-to-severe depression and 3% had pronounced suicidal ideation. Systemic treatment of AD significantly reduced both depression and AD symptoms at 6 months, and this positive effect remained at 12 months. In conclusion, depressive symptoms are common among adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Systemic treatment of AD significantly reduced depressive symptoms in parallel with AD symptoms.","Ivert, Lina U; Svedbom, Axel; Lundqvist, Maria; Wahlgren, Carl-Fredrik; Bradley, Maria; Johansson, Emma K",Acta dermato-venereologica,1651-2057,10.2340/actadv.v102.803,36193008,"Dermatology and Venereology Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.

The basic therapy involves the application of anti-inflammatory topical drugs like; glucocorticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Phototherapy in AD is regarded as an additional form of treatment. The latest invention, ultraviolet A1-UVA1 phototherapy (340-400 nm), was introduced to the treatment of AD by Krutmann et al in 1992. It appears that the main mode of action of UVA1 phototherapy in AD is through activation of apoptosis of T lymphocytes. Additionally, new studies show that UVA1 can also inhibit the activity of calcineurin phosphatase, similarly to calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A or tacrolimus. The aim of this study is to, for the first time, compare the efficacy of medium dose UVA1 phototherapy and tacrolimus ointment in patients with moderate-severe AD.","Osmola-Mańkowska, A; Polańska, A; Silny, W; Żaba, R; Adamski, Z; Dańczak-Pazdrowska, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2284-0729,,25555886,"Department and Clinic of Dermatology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. agnieszka.osmola@wp.pl.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25555886,0,0,,81

In the course of screening anti-inflammatory agents, we obtained BSASM, a mixture of several plant extracts. This study was designed to investigate the AD-mitigating effect of BSASM in patients, as well as its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in an in vitro experiment. The anti-inflammatory effects of BSASM were evaluated by the level of production of proinflammatory cytokines. Clinical evaluation was also done using eczema area severity index (EASI) score in AD patients. BSASM inhibited LPS-induced activation of NF-kappaB promoter. In addition, LPS-induced an increase of IL-8, and the TNF-alpha production in THP-1 cells was also inhibited. These results suggest that BSASM has an anti-inflammatory activity. A clinical study in patients with AD showed that BSASM induced a reduction of EASI score, degree of pruritus, and TEWL on both the antecubital fossa and abdomen. Besides, BSASM had no irritative or allergic effects.

Doxycycline is tetracycline antibiotics broadly used systemically to treat inflammatory dermatologic conditions.

49,A daily regimen of a ceramide-dominant moisturizing cream and cleanser restores the skin permeability barrier in adults with moderate eczema: A randomized trial.,Jul-21,"The dysfunctional skin barrier in eczema patients may be attributed to decreased levels of ceramides in the stratum corneum. The aim of this study was to determine whether a two-part system consisting of a ceramide-dominant physiological lipid-based moisturizing cream and cleanser could ameliorate the signs and symptoms of moderate eczema in adults over 28 days compared to placebo. Assessments were conducted at baseline and every 7 days thereafter. Eczema area severity index score decreased significantly across all time points in both groups compared to baseline (P < .0001), however, this decrease was not significant between groups at day 28 (P = .7804). In contrast, transepidermal water loss and skin hydration significantly improved over time in the active group, while it either stayed the same or worsened in the placebo group (P = .0342 and P < .0001, respectively). There was no difference in the use of mometasone furoate as rescue medication over time between groups (P = .1579). Dermatology life quality index scores improved significantly in both groups (P < .0001), with no difference between groups (P = .5256). However, patient satisfaction was greater in the active compared to the placebo group for several parameters including relief of itch, dry skin, skin softness and smoothness (all P < .05). No patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events (AEs) and there were no serious AEs. The ceramide-dominant moisturizing cream and cleanser safely restores skin permeability and improves the signs and symptoms of eczema in adults.","Spada, Fabrizio; Harrison, Ian P; Barnes, Tanya M; Greive, Kerryn A; Daniels, Daisy; Townley, Joshua P; Mostafa, Niyaz; Fong, Andrew T; Tong, Philip L; Shumack, Stephen",Dermatologic therapy,1529-8019,10.1111/dth.14970,33984185,"Department of Scientific Affairs, Ego Pharmaceuticals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Scientific Affairs, Ego Pharmaceuticals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Scientific Affairs, Ego Pharmaceuticals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Scientific Affairs, Ego Pharmaceuticals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Scientific Affairs, Ego Pharmaceuticals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Scientific Affairs, Ego Pharmaceuticals, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; St George Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; St George Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; St George Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Dermatology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; The Skin Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; St George Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; The Skin Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; Department of Dermatology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33984185,0,0,,94

61,Effects of Colloidal Oatmeal Topical Atopic Dermatitis Cream on Skin Microbiome and Skin Barrier Properties.,May-20,"Atopic dermatitis is characterized by dry, itchy, inflamed skin with a dysbiotic microbiome. In this clinical study (NCT03673059), we compared the effects of an eczema cream containing 1% colloidal oat and a standard moisturizer on the skin microbiome and skin barrier function of patients with mild to moderate eczema. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 1% colloidal oat eczema cream or a standard, non-fragranced daily moisturizer. Treatment lasted 14 days, followed by a 7-day regression period. Of 61 patients who completed the study, 30 received the 1% colloidal oat eczema cream and 31 received the standard moisturizer. At 14 days, the 1% colloidal oat eczema cream reduced mean Eczema Area Severity Index and Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index scores by 51% and 54%, respectively. Unlike treatment with the standard moisturizer, treatment with the 1% colloidal oat eczema cream was associated with trends towards lower prevalence of Staphylococcus species and higher microbiome diversity at lesion sites. The 1% colloidal oat eczema cream significantly improved skin pH, skin barrier function, and skin hydration from baseline to day 14, whereas the standard moisturizer improved hydration. Overall, the results demonstrate that topical products can have differing effects on the skin barrier properties and the microbiome. Importantly, we show that the use of a 1% colloidal oat eczema cream improves microbiome composition and significantly repairs skin barrier defects.
