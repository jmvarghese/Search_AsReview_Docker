Change in the kinetics of sulphacetamide tissue distribution in Walker tumor-bearing rats.,1975,"The effect of Walker tumor on sulphacetamide distribution was studied in rats 21 days after tumor implantation in a hind leg. After oral administration of sulphacetamide (5 and 20 min), the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of tumor-bearing rats when compared with that of control group. However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Contrary to what was observed after oral administration, constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats after iv injection of sulphacetamide. Furthermore, the half-life of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals. It is concluded that, in Walker tumor-bearing rats, there are changes in the kinetics of sulphacetamide which are functions of the route of administration of the drug.","Nadeau, D; Marchand, C",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,0090-9556,,1234,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1234,

"Efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: 52-week results of two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (ADvocate1 and ADvocate2)",JAN 25 2023,"Lebrikizumab (LEB) is a novel, high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to interleukin (IL)-13. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of LEB monotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in two identical phase 3 trials ADvocate1 (ADv1) and ADvocate2 (ADv2). Patients who responded to LEB 250mg every 2 weeks (LEB Q2W) at the end of the 16-week induction period were re-randomized in a 2 : 2 : 1 ratio to receive LEB Q2W, LEB 250mg every 4 weeks (LEB Q4W) or placebo (LEB withdrawal) for an additional 36 weeks. Response, at week 16, was defined as achieving an IGA (0, 1) with a >= 2-point improvement or EASI75 and no use of rescue medication. Efficacy outcomes reported at week 52 included IGA (0, 1), EASI 75, >= 4-point reduction in Pruritis Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), EASI 90 and DLQI >= 4-point. Safety analysis was conducted on all patients who received >= 1 dose of LEB. Patients maintained IGA (0, 1) in LEB Q2W (ADv1, 75.8%; ADv2, 64.6%), LEB Q4W (ADv1, 74.2%; ADv2, 80.6%) and LEB withdrawal (ADv1, 46.5%; ADv2, 49.8%). Maintenance of EASI75 was, in LEB Q2W (ADv1, 79.2%; ADv2, 77.4%), LEB Q4W (ADv1, 79.2%; ADv2, 84.7%) and LEB withdrawal (ADv1, 61.3%; ADv2, 72.0%). For Pruritus NRS >= 4-point improvement from baseline, patients-maintained improvement in the LEB Q2W (ADv1, 81.2%; ADv2, 90.3%), LEB Q4W (ADv1, 80.4%; ADv2, 88.1%) and LEB withdrawal (ADv1, 65.4%; ADv2, 67.6%). Maintenance of EASI90 was, in LEB Q2W (ADv1, 66.1%; ADv2, 61.5%), LEB Q4W (ADv1, 66.6%; ADv2, 67.4%) and LEB withdrawal (ADv1, 45.5%; ADv2, 36.9%). DLQI >= 4-point improvement from baseline was LEB Q2W (ADv1, 64.0%; ADv2, 59.0%), LEB Q4W (ADv1, 62.7%; ADv2, 73.0%) and LEB withdrawal (ADv1, 57.7%; ADv2, 45.5%). TEAEs were reported by 58.1% (ADv1) and 67.8% (ADv2) LEB-treated patients at week 52. Serious adverse events were reported by 3.3% of ADv1 patients and 2.7% of ADv2 patients. In ADv1 and ADv2, 2.3% and 3.9% of patients reported an adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation, respectively. Both LEB Q2W and LEB Q4W maintained improvement in all reported outcomes for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD through 52 weeks. The safety profile was consistent with previously published data.","Blauvelt, Andrew [Author, Reprint Author]; Thyssen, Jacob P.

"Dupilumab treatment improves signs, symptoms, quality of life, and work productivity in patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis: Results from a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial",,"Background: Despite high disease burden, systemic treatment options for patients with atopic hand and/or foot dermatitis (H/F AD) are limited. Objective(s): To evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab in H/F AD using specific instruments for assessing disease severity on hands and feet. Method(s): In this multicenter phase 3 trial, adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe H/F AD were randomized to dupilumab monotherapy (regimen approved for generalized AD), or matched placebo. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving Hand and Foot Investigator's Global Assessment score 0 or 1 at week 16. Secondary prespecified endpoints assessed the severity and extent of signs, symptom intensity (itch, pain), quality of life, and sleep. Result(s): A total of 133 patients (adults = 106, adolescents = 27) were randomized to dupilumab (n = 67) or placebo (n = 66). At week 16, significantly more patients receiving dupilumab (n = 27) than placebo (n = 11) achieved Hand and Foot Investigator's Global Assessment score 0 or 1 (40.3% vs 16.7%; P = .003). All other prespecified endpoints were met. Safety was consistent with the known AD dupilumab profile. Limitation(s): Short-term, 16-week treatment period.

IMPLICATIONS FOR NON-INVASIVE BIOMARKERS OF EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS BASED ON RESULTS FROM A PHASE 2 TRIAL OF CENDAKIMAB IN ATOPIC DERMATITIS,,"Background: Cendakimab is a recombinant, humanized, high-affinity, neutralizing monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin 13 (IL-13) and blocks interaction with both its receptors, IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2. IL-13 is a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and is thought to be a key driver of the complex pathophysiology of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). IL-13 signals through both IL-13Ralpha1 and IL-13Ralpha2 to regulate cellular and molecular pathways involving various cell types. The binding of IL-13 to IL-13Ralpha1 promotes type 2 immune response and eosinophil recruitment, whereas the binding of IL-13 to IL-13Ralpha2 is believed to play a role in fibrosis and epithelial tissue remodeling. Several biomarkers associated with type 2 inflammatory diseases are known to be regulated by IL-13. Eotaxin-3, a key biomarker, plays a central role in attracting eosinophils to the site of inflammation. Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein linked to activated fibroblasts, is implicated in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Another enzyme governed by IL-13 is matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12)-this enzyme contributes to tissue remodeling and breakdown of extracellular matrix components. Here, we evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of IL-13 inhibition with cendakimab on the key serum biomarkers, eotaxin-3, periostin, and MMP-12, in patients with AD, with a focus on exploring potential implications for EoE. Method(s): In this phase 2, multicenter, global, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (NCT04800315), 220 adults with moderate-to-severe AD received cendakimab 360 mg Q2W, 720 mg QW, 720 mg Q2W, or placebo for 16 weeks. Blood samples were collected, and a panel of biomarkers were assessed. The current analysis focuses on the assessment of serum levels of eotaxin-3, periostin, and MMP-12 using Proximity Extension Assay pre- and post-treatment on day 1 (baseline), at week 1 and week 2, and then biweekly until week 16. The least square mean percent change from baseline at week 16 for each treatment group was evaluated. Result(s): For all 3 doses of cendakimab, there was a significant decrease from baseline in the levels of eotaxin-3, periostin, and MMP-12 as early as week 1 post-treatment and continued through week 16 of cendakimab treatment (Table). Compared with placebo, cendakimab resulted in significantly greater reductions in these biomarker levels through week 16. Conclusion(s): Cendakimab decreased levels of key inflammatory and remodeling biomarkers over 16 weeks of treatment in patients with AD. These findings suggest that cendakimab modulates pathways of inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling in AD and add to the existing clinical evidence of its modulation in other type 2 inflammatory diseases such as EoE.

27571 Dupilumab provides clinically meaningful responses in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD): Results from LIBERTY AD CHRONOS study,,"Background: AD, a common chronic skin condition, has substantial impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Stringent regulatory endpoints of Investigator Global Assessment score 0/1 and 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) capture the AD skin lesion component, without encompassing all clinical endpoints. More inclusive tools are often needed to assess clinically meaningful responses in AD patients. We assess the effect of 52-week dupilumab treatment on a composite endpoint incorporating improvement in AD signs (EASI-75), symptoms (Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale[PP-NRS] score<=4), and HRQoL (Dermatology Life Quality Index[DLQI]<=5) in adult AD patients. Method(s): In LIBERTY AD CHRONOS (NCT02260986), 740 adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 3:1:3 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300mg weekly, dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (q2w; FDA-approved dose), or placebo; with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). We report mean EASI, PP-NRS, and DLQI values at baseline and Week (Wk)52; and proportion of patients attaining the composite endpoint (EASI-75, PP-NRS<=4, or DLQI<=5) at Wk52 in the dupilumab q2w (n = 106) and placebo (n = 315) groups only. We report nominal P-values. Result(s): For q2w+TCS/placebo+TCS, baseline and Wk52 values were: EASI (baseline: 33.6/32.6; Wk52: 4.5/9.0); PP-NRS (baseline: 7.4/7.3; Wk52: 2.6/3.9); and DLQI (baseline: 14.5/14.7; Wk52: 2.9/6.3). A significantly higher proportion of dupilumab+TCS-treated patients achieved the composite endpoint compared with placebo+TCS (q2w+TCS: 77.4%, placebo+TCS: 30.2%; P <.0001). The safety profile reported here was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

Dupilumab is efficacious in patients with prurigo nodularis regardless of history of atopic comorbidities: Pooled results from two phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-PN PRIME and PRIME2),,"Introduction (context of the research): Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by severely itchy skin nodules. Nearly half of affected adult patients have a history of (or current) atopic comorbidity, such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective(s): To report the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with PN with or without history of atopic comorbidities, in a pre-specified analysis of pooled data from two phase 3 trials. Method(s): In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week studies, LIBERTY-PN PRIME (NCT04183335) and PRIME2 (NCT04202679), adults with PN inadequately controlled by topical prescription therapies, were randomized 1:1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched placebo. Atopic patients were defined as patients with a physician-documented history, or current diagnosis, of at least one of the following atopic comorbidities: AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy. Efficacy was assessed from baseline to Week 24 through the Worst Itch Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS; 0-10), and the Investigator's Global Assessment for PN-Stage score (IGA PN-S; 0-4). Result(s): In total, 311 patients were randomized (dupilumab n = 153, atopic/non-atopic n = 67/86; placebo, n = 158, atopic/non-atopic, n = 68/90). At week 24, significantly more atopic and non-atopic dupilumab-treated patients achieved a >= 4-point improvement in WI-NRS (58.2/59.3%), and an IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 (52.2/41.9%) vs. placebo (20.6/17.8% [nominal P < 0.0001/P < 0.0001] and 16.2/17.8% [nominal P < 0.0001/P = 0.0005], respectively). The proportion of patients achieving concomitant >= 4-point improvement in WI-NRS and IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 was higher for both dupilumab-treated atopic and non-atopic patients (37.3/33.7%) vs. placebo (7.4/10.0% [nominal P = 0.0057/P < 0.007]). Overall safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile, with no remarkable differences between atopic and non-atopic patients.

Baseline serum biomarkers do not predict dupilumab treatment response in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction: (context of the research) Previous analyses based on short-term, phase 2 studies reported that baseline biomarkers do not correlate with clinical outcomes following dupilumab treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective(s): To report whether pre-treatment levels of common serum biomarkers can predict treatment response to dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD using data from a new analysis based on 16-week, phase 3 studies. Method(s): LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and 2 (NCT02277743, NCT02277769), two randomized, double-blind studies, included patients >= 18 years-old with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. Correlation between change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and log of baseline IgE, CC chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17; previously referred to as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine [TARC]) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho). Result(s): At Week 16, change in EASI showed little correlation with baseline total IgE (Spearman's correlation coefficient [rho] = -0.14, n = 370 for dupilumab; rho = -0.03, n = 202 for placebo), baseline CCL17 (rho = -0.28, n = 369 for dupilumab; rho = -0.05, n = 201 for placebo), or baseline LDH (rho = -0.30, n = 370 for dupilumab; rho = -0.08, n = 202 for placebo). Overall safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

"Efficacy of dupilumab treatment in atopic hand and foot dermatitis across morphological subtypes: Results from a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial",,"Introduction (context of the research): Dupilumab has previously shown to significantly improve signs, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis. Objective(s): To investigate the efficacy of dupilumab across morphological subtypes in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis. Method(s): The phase 3, randomized, double-blind LIBERTY-AD-HAFT (NCT04417894) trial enrolled patients aged >= 12 years with moderate-to-severe (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3/4) atopic hand and foot dermatitis. Patients were randomized to dupilumab monotherapy 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) in adults; 200/300 mg q2w in adolescents, or placebo for 16 weeks. This analysis reports the percent change from baseline in modified total lesion sign score (mTLSS) by hand and foot morphological subtypes: chronic dry fissured, hyperkeratotic (palmar/plantar), and other. Result(s): In total, 133 patients enrolled into this study and were randomized to dupilumab (n = 67) or placebo (n = 66).

Dupilumab Consistently Reduces CCL-17 (TARC) in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis Across All Age Groups,,"Rationale: Elevated serum C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17)/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) has been associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) severity. Reductions in type 2 inflammatory biomarkers such as CCL17/TARC have been reported in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab. Method(s): We report serum CCL17/TARC (human TARC Quantikine ELISA kit; R&D Systems) levels from patients with moderate-to-severe or severe AD enrolled in the following randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies, receiving approved dose regimens: LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL (6 months to 5 years; NCT03346434 part B); LIBERTY AD PEDS (6 to11 years; NCT03345914); LIBERTY AD ADOL (12 to17 years; NCT03054428); LIBERTY AD SOLO1 (18 years or older; NCT02277743); LIBERTY AD SOLO2 (18 years or older; NCT02277769). Result(s): There was a significant reduction, compared to placebo, in median percentage change from baseline in serum CCL17/TARC (pg/mL) in all dupilumab-treated arms across all age groups (P < 0.0001 at Week 16). This reduction was seen as early as after the first dose in all age ranges (P < 0.0001 vs placebo). Conclusion(s): Dupilumab treatment in adult and pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD induces rapid and sustained reduction of serum CCL17/TARC levels. The reduction in serum CCL17/TARC, likely reflects skin reductions as noted in earlier transcriptomics studies and is probably at least in part responsible for the reduced infiltration of leukocytes into lesional skin.Copyright © 2023",Beck L.; Boguniewicz M.; Kataoka Y.; de Bruin-Weller M.; Muraro A.; Chen Z.; Rodriguez-Marco A.; Shah P.; Rossi A.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2023.11.064,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2023.11.064,
"Treatment efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who switched from dupilumab to abrocitinib in JADE EXTEND, a phase 3 long-term extension study",,"Background Abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily, Janus kinase 1-selective inhibitor, and dupilumab, an anti-interleukin 4 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody, have been approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The efficacy of abrocitinib and dupilumab as monotherapy or in combination with medicated topical therapy has been demonstrated in multiple phase 3 clinical trials. As is the case with many therapies, some patients with AD may need to discontinue treatment with dupilumab (due to inadequate efficacy, intolerable side-effects, patient choice, or other reasons) and switch to other systemic therapies. Objective To evaluate the long-term treatment response in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who switched from dupilumab to abrocitinib, as it is valuable information for prescribers and patients to consider when making treatment decisions. Methods The phase 3 JADE COMPARE trial (NCT03720470) evaluated the efficacy of abrocitinib (100 mg or 200 mg once daily) and dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) versus placebo in combination with topical medicated therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe AD through week 16. After a wash-out period, dupilumab-treated patients from JADE COMPARE who enrolled in the ongoing long-term extension trial JADE EXTEND (NCT03422822; clinical data cutoff: Sept 25, 2021) were randomised to receive double-blinded treatment with abrocitinib 100 mg or 200 mg. This post hoc analysis evaluated the response to dupilumab through week 16 in JADE COMPARE and thereafter in JADE EXTEND following a switch to abrocitinib through week 104 of total treatment duration/week 84 of abrocitinib treatment. Assessments included Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with a >=2-point improvement from baseline (IGA 0/1), >=75% or >=90% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75 or EASI-90), >=4-point improvement from baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score (PP-NRS4; PP-NRS used with permission from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Sanofi), and a PP-NRS score of 0 or 1 (PP-NRS 0/1). JADE EXTEND data are presented as observed; patients with missing data at a visit were excluded. Analyses included both dupilumab responders and non-responders. Results Overall, 242 patients were treated with dupilumab in JADE COMPARE (mean age: 37 years; IGA score 4: 33%). Of those, 203 enrolled in JADE EXTEND and received abrocitinib 200 mg (n=73) or abrocitinib 100 mg (n=130). After 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab in JADE COMPARE, the proportion of responders was 39% for IGA 0/1, 66% for EASI-75, 39% for EASI-90, 57% for PP-NRS4, and 24% for PP-NRS 0/1. As early as 2 weeks after switching to abrocitinib (200 mg/100 mg) in JADE EXTEND, the proportion of responders was observed to increase in a dose-dependent manner, respectively, for IGA 0/1 (61%; 51%), EASI-75 (90%; 85%), EASI-90 (60%; 54%), PPNRS4 (81%; 72%), and PP-NRS 0/1 (47%; 37%). Long-term efficacy was observed out to week 84 (Figure). Conclusions In patients with moderate-to-severe AD who received prior treatment with dupilumab, switching to abrocitinib resulted in dose-dependent increases in the proportion of responders as early as week 2 after treatment with abrocitinib. This efficacy continued to be observed long-term through week 84 of abrocitinib treatment.",,,0007-0963,/10.1093/bjd/ljad498.035,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad498.035,
Rapid skin clearance and itch improvement with upadacitinib versus dupilumab in adults with moderate-tosevere atopic dermatitis: results from a phase 3b head-to-head clinical trial (Heads Up),,"Introduction/Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disease characterized by multiple skin manifestations and intense itching that can impact patient quality of life. The effect of upadacitinib (UPA) and dupilumab (DUP) was evaluated in a double-blind, double-dummy, head-to-head phase 3b clinical trial (Heads Up; NCT03738397) of adult patients (age: 18-75 years) with moderate-to-severe AD (Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI] >=16; body surface area >=10%; validated Investigator Global Assessment of Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) >=3 at screening and baseline; Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [WP-NRS] >=4 at baseline) randomized 1:1 to UPA 30 mg orally once-daily (N=348) or DUP 300 mg subcutaneous injection every two weeks after a 600 mg loading dose (N=344). Objective The effects of UPA and DUP on skin clearance and itch improvement are reported here. Methods Skin clearance was assessed by EASI, with response defined as an improvement >=75% (EASI75), >=90% (EASI90), and 100% (EASI100) from baseline. Itch intensity was assessed daily by WP-NRS up to week 16, then at study visits up to week 24. Weekly WP-NRS scores were analyzed as a 7-day rolling average up to week 16, then at study visits through week 24. Daily WPNRS scores were analyzed day-to-day through day 28. Mean percent improvement and the proportion of patients achieving clinically meaningful improvement (>=4-point improvement from baseline) were evaluated. The proportion of patients achieving a state of no/minimal itch (defined as WP-NRS score of 0/1) was evaluated as a post-hoc analysis. Results EASI75/90/100 response rates were significantly greater with UPA versus DUP at week 16 (UPA = 72.4%/61.6%/28.4%, DUP = 62.6%/40.3%/7.9%; P<0.01 for all comparisons), with greater EASI75 and EASI90 rates observed with UPA as early as week 1 (nominal P<0.05). Mean percent improvement in weekly WPNRS was significantly greater with UPA versus DUP at week 16 (UPA = 67.8%, DUP= 49.6%; P<0.001), with greater improvement observed as early as week 1 (nominal P<0.001). Daily WP-NRS data showed a greater mean percent improvement with UPA versus DUP as early as day 2, the day after the first dose (UPA = 22.0%, DUP = 4.2%; nominal P<0.001). The proportion of patients that achieved clinically meaningful improvement in weekly WP-NRS was significantly greater with UPA versus DUP at week 16 (UPA = 56.1%, DUP = 36.4%; P<0.001), with greater proportions observed as early as week 1 (nominal P<0.001). Daily WP-NRS data showed a greater proportion of patients achieved clinically meaningful improvement with UPA versus DUP as early as day 2 (UPA = 15.3%, DUP = 3.4%; nominal P<0.001). The proportion of patients that achieved a state of no/minimal itch based on weekly WP-NRS was greater with UPA versus DUP at week 16 (UPA = 35.5%, DUP = 16.2%; nominal P<0.001) and at week 1 (nominal P<0.001). Conclusions Skin clearance and itch improvement were consistently better with UPA compared with DUP in adult patients with moderateto-severe AD, with greater improvements observed as early as week 1 for skin clearance and the day following treatment for itch improvement.",,,0007-0963,/10.1093/bjd/ljad498.033,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad498.033,
Efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: analysis of time spent in itch response state from the Heads Up study,,"Introduction/Background Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense and debilitating pruritus - its most burdensome symptom - and requires long-term control. Results from the Heads Up trial (NCT03738397) found that upadacitinib (UPA) 30 mg was superior to dupilumab (DUPI) 300 mg for improving itch as indicated by increases in the percent of improvement from baseline for Worst Pruritus NRS scores (WPNRS). Objective This analysis compared the proportion of days patients treated with UPA or DUPI spent in itch response states indicated by WPNRS. Methods Heads Up was a 24-week head-to-head phase 3b multicenter, randomized, double-blind study comparing UPA 30 mg to DUPI 300 mg in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. We compared the proportion of days patients treated with UPA or DUPI spent in an improved-itch state (WP-NRS improvement >=4 relative to baseline; among patients with baseline WP-NRS >=4) or a state of no/minimal itch (WP-NRS 0/1; among patients with baseline WP-NRS >1). Results Participants included 673 patients randomized into two groups: those taking UPA (N=342) or DUPI (N=331). At 4 and 16 weeks, patients treated with UPA vs DUPI spent a greater proportion of days in an improved-itch state (week 4: 50.0% vs 19.3%; week 16: 60.4% vs 35.7%), and in a state of no/minimal itch (week 4: 22.1% vs 4.3%; week 16: 34.4% vs 11.4%). Conclusions Treatment of moderate-to-severe AD with UPA 30 mg daily resulted in a greater proportion of days spent with meaningful itch improvement (WP-NRS improvement >=4) and more time with no/minimal itch (WP-NRS 0/1) compared to treatment with DUPI over 4 and 16 weeks.",,,0007-0963,/10.1093/bjd/ljad498.031,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad498.031,
Lebrikizumab demonstrates significant efficacy versus placebo across racial and ethnic subgroups in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction/Background The efficacy of monotherapy lebrikizumab to treat moderateto-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) has been established in phase 3 studies. Disease characteristics and efficacy outcomes may vary among racial and ethnic subgroups. Objectives To report the week 16 efficacy results of lebrikizumab-treated patients by racial and ethnic subgroups from ADvocate1 (NCT04146363) and ADvocate2 (NCT04178967). Methods Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive lebrikizumab or placebo every 2 weeks. Other AD treatments during this induction period were prohibited. The week 16 efficacy endpoints reported here include Investigator's Global Assessment 0 or 1 with >=2-point improvement from baseline (IGA 0/1), >=75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index from baseline (EASI 75), >=90% improvement in EASI from baseline (EASI 90), and >=4-point Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) improvement from baseline. Race and ethnicity were selfreported. Data were collected globally. Data were pooled from ADvocate1 (Intent to Treat [ITT]) and ADvocate2 (modified ITT). Subsequent data from patients who received topical or systemic rescue medication or discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy were imputed as nonresponders. Subsequent data from patients who discontinued treatment for other reasons were set to missing. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation. Logistic regression tested the interaction between the treatment by subgroup. P>0.1 indicated consistent treatment effect of lebrikizumab versus placebo across subgroups. For each outcome, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method evaluated treatment effect within each subgroup after adjusting for stratification factors. Results Most patients (818/851 [96.1%]) were Asian (192 [22.6%]), Black/African American (84 [9.9%]), or White (542 [63.7%]). Due to the low proportion of patients identifying as another racial category (33/851 [3.9%]) including American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, multiple, other, and not reported, only results of Asian, Black/African American, and White subgroups are reported. In patients with completed ethnicity data (N=839), 10.8% (91/839) identified as Hispanic/Latino and 89.2% (748/839) identified as not Hispanic/Latino. At baseline, Asian patients reported a numerically earlier mean age of AD onset (8.3 years) compared to White (16.5 years) and Black/African American (16.9 years) patients. A numerically greater proportion of Asian patients presented with severe (IGA 4) disease at baseline (49.5%) and prior use of systemic treatment for AD (75.5%) compared with White (35.1% and 51.1%, respectively) and Black/African American (33.3% and 36.9%, respectively) patients. At week 16, no significant treatment differences were observed for the proportion of patients achieving or reporting IGA 0/1, EASI 75, EASI 90, or >=4-point Pruritus NRS improvement across racial or ethnic subgroups (p>0.1). In Asian patients, a higher proportion treated with lebrikizumab vs placebo (p<0.001) achieved or reported IGA 0/1 (25.1%, 4.1%), EASI 75 (45.5%, 8.5%), EASI 90 (26.5%, 4.3%), and Pruritus NRS >=4-point improvement (36.4%, 5.7%). In Black/African American patients, a greater proportion treated with lebrikizumab versus placebo achieved or reported IGA 0/1 (33.2%, 13.2%) EASI 75 (51.7%, 18.8%), EASI 90 (26.9%, 13.2%), and >=4-point Pruritus NRS improvement (41.7%, 17.4%). No statistical comparisons were performed due to limited sample size. In White patients treated with lebrikizumab, statistical significance was observed versus placebo (p<0.001) for IGA 0/1 (43.3%, 14.1%), EASI 75 (59.7%, 20.4%), EASI 90 (38.3%, 10.9%), and Pruritus NRS >=4-point improvement (45.9%, 14.8%). Significant and similar differences with lebrikizumab-treatment versus placebo were observed among IGA 0/1, EASI 75, and >=4-point Pruritus NRS improvement in Hispanic/Latino (p<0.05) and nonHispanic/Latino (p<0.001) patients. The proportion of lebrikizumab-treated patients achieving EASI 90 versus placebo was numerically greater in Hispanic/Latino patients (p=0.057) but only reached statistical significance in non-Hispanic/Latino patients (p<0.001). Conclusions In ADvocate1 and ADvocate2, lebrikizumab was effective across racial and ethnic subgroups for the treatment of moderate-tosevere AD after 16 weeks of monotherapy treatment.",,,0007-0963,/10.1093/bjd/ljad498.024,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad498.024,

Objective To investigate the efficacy of dupilumab across morphological subtypes in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic hand and foot dermatitis. Methods The phase 3, randomized, double-blind LIBERTY-AD-HAFT (NCT04417894) trial enrolled patients aged >=12 years with moderate-to-severe (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3/4) atopic hand and foot dermatitis. Patients were randomized to dupilumab monotherapy 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) in adults; 200/300 mg q2w in adolescents, or placebo for 16 weeks. This analysis reports the percent change from baseline in modified total lesion sign score (mTLSS) by hand and foot morphological subtypes: chronic dry fissured, hyperkeratotic (palmar/plantar), and other. Results 133 patients enrolled into this study and were randomized to dupilumab (n = 67) or placebo (n = 66). Atopic hand and foot morphologies were reported in 3 categories: chronic dry fissured (n = 63), hyperkeratotic (palmar/plantar; n = 37), and other (n = 33) In the other category, dyshidrotic was the most frequent morphology (n = 13). mTLSS values were similar at baseline for all morphological subtypes. At Week 16, greater improvements were seen in the percent change from baseline (SE) in mTLSS for patients receiving dupilumab vs placebo in all categories: chronic dry fissured (-65.6% [5.1] vs -31.5% [6.2]), hyperkeratotic (palmar/plantar; -58.2% [7.6] vs -11.8% [7.7]), and other (-64.5% [11.6] vs -29.9% [9.0]).

Dupilumab is efficacious in patients with prurigo nodularis regardless of history of atopic comorbidities: pooled results from two phase 3 trials (LIBERTYPN PRIME and PRIME2),,"Introduction Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by severely itchy skin nodules. Nearly half of affected adult patients have a history of (or current) atopic comorbidity, such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective To report the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with PN with or without history of atopic comorbidities, in a prespecified analysis of pooled data from two phase 3 trials. Method In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week studies, LIBERTY-PN PRIME (NCT04183335) and PRIME2 (NCT04202679), adults with PN inadequately controlled by topical prescription therapies, were randomized 1:1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched placebo. Atopic patients were defined as patients with a physician-documented history, or current diagnosis, of at least one of the following atopic comorbidities: AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy. Efficacy was assessed from baseline to Week 24 through the Worst Itch Numerical Rating Scale (WINRS; 0-10), and the Investigator's Global Assessment for PNStage score (IGA PN-S; 0-4). Results 311 patients were randomized (dupilumab n=153, atopic/nonatopic N=67/86; placebo n=158, atopic/non-atopic N=68/90). At Week 24, significantly more atopic and non-atopic dupilumabtreated patients achieved a >=4-point improvement in WI-NRS (58.2%/59.3%), and an IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 (52.2%/41.9%) vs placebo (20.6%/17.8% [nominal P<0.0001/P<0.0001] and 16.2%/17.8% [nominal P<0.0001/P=0.0005], respectively). The proportion of patients achieving concomitant >=4-point improvement in WI-NRS and IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 was higher for both dupilumab-treated atopic and non-atopic patients (37.3%/33.7%) vs placebo (7.4%/10.0% [nominal P=0.0057/P<0.007]). Overall safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile, with no remarkable differences between atopic and non-atopic patients.

Lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids maintains improvements in itch and sleep at 68 weeks in patients with moderate-tosevere atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction/Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic disease affecting children and adults and requires long-term treatment. Moderate-tosevere AD causes itching, which considerably impacts sleep. Interleukin (IL)-13 is the key cytokine in the skin of patients with AD. Lebrikizumab (LEB) is a novel monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to IL-13, thereby blocking the downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. LEB has demonstrated efficacy and maintained improvement in measures of itch and sleep over 52 weeks in previous phase 3 trials. ADhere (NCT04250337) was a 16-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial, where patients were treated with LEB and topical corticosteroids (TCS) vs placebo and TCS. LEB responders from ADhere at week 16 were defined as having Investigator's Global Assessment response of 0 or 1 or reporting 75% improvement from ADhere baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index who did not use rescue medications. ADhere LEB responders were rerandomized 2:1 into ADjoin (NCT04392154) for blinded treatment with LEB 250 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W), respectively, with TCS use as needed, for an additional 100 weeks with itch and sleep data being collected for the first 52 weeks. Objectives The objectives of the study are to report the impact of LEB on itch and sleep improvements over a longer period (68 weeks) in ADhere week 16 LEB responders with moderate-to-severe AD who entered a long-term extension study, ADjoin. Methods Itch was reported using the Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), a patient-reported, single-item, daily, 11-point scale, where the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is 3 points. Sleep loss due to itch was reported using the Sleep-Loss Scale, a patient-reported, single-item, 5-point scale, where the MCID is 1 point. We report >=3-point improvement in Pruritus NRS among patients with baseline score at least 3, percent change from ADhere baseline (PCFB) in Pruritus NRS, Pruritus NRS (0,1), >=1-point improvement in Sleep-Loss Scale score among patients with baseline score at least 1, >=2-point improvement in Sleep-Loss Scale score among patients with baseline score at least 2 and PCFB in Sleep-Loss Scale score. All outcomes were reported at week 52 of ADjoin study, after a total of 68 weeks of LEB treatment. As observed analyses used all data collected. Results At week 68, most patients reported maintaining >=3-point improvement in Pruritus NRS treated with LEB Q2W (80.6%, 29/36) and LEB Q4W (88.9%, 16/18). Patients treated with LEB Q2W and LEB Q4W reported maintaining 65.3% and 59.4% improvement in Pruritus NRS at week 68 compared to ADhere baseline, respectively. At week 68, 45.9% (17/37) patients in LEB Q2W group and 31.6% (6/19) in LEB Q4W group reached Pruritus NRS of 0 or 1. At week 68, most patients reported maintaining >=1-point improvement in Sleep-Loss Scale score treated with LEB Q2W (96.9%, 31/32) and LEB Q4W (85.7%, 12/14). Similarly, most patients reported maintaining >=2-point improvement in Sleep-Loss Scale score treated with LEB Q2W (60.9%, 14/23) and LEB Q4W (75.0%, 6/8). Patients treated with LEB Q2W and Q4W reported maintaining 84.1% and 58.8% improvement in Sleep Loss Scale score at week 68, respectively, compared to ADhere baseline.

Improvement of the head and neck regions with continuous tralokinumab treatment for up to 4 years in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease that can affect multiple regions of the body, but can be particularly burdensome on exposed areas of skin, such as the head and neck (H&N).Tralokinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes interleukin-13, is approved in multiple countries for adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Phase 3 trials showed tralokinumab provided significant improvements in AD severity and was well-tolerated up to 52 weeks of treatment. The ongoing open-label, 5-year extension trial, ECZTEND (NCT03587805), assesses the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab after the completion of parent trials (PT). Objective To assess tralokinumab efficacy in the head and neck region. Methods This post hoc analysis included adult patients with moderateto-severe AD initially randomized to tralokinumab 300mg Q2W in the phase 3 PTs ECZTRA 1 (NCT03131648) or ECZTRA 2 (NCT03160885). Patients on active tralokinumab treatment were followed for up to 52 weeks in PTs and for up to 152 weeks in ECZTEND as of data cutoff April 30, 2022. Patients re randomized to placebo at Week (Wk) 16 were not included beyond that timepoint. For this analysis, overall EASI and H&N regional EASI (H&N EASI) were evaluated. H&N EASI (0-7.2) was calculated based on the severity of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, lichenification and area of involvement. All data were analyzed and presented as observed. Results At baseline, 87.8% (1047/1192) of patients had H&N involvement (H&N EASI>1), and 49.9% (591/1192) of patients exhibited severe AD (IGA 4). Baseline median H&N EASI for the pooled PTs was 3.0 (IQR 1.8; 4.5). In the pooled PTs, 48.2% (542/1125) and 71.2% (558/784) of patients achieved H&N EASI<=1, at Wk16 and Wk52, respectively. After 3 years additional treatment (Wk152 in ECZTEND), the proportion of patients with H&N EASI<=1 was 87.2% (232/266) and the median H&N EASI was 0.2 (IQR 0.0; 0.5). In the subgroup of patients (n=301) with severe AD (IGA 4) and high H&N involvement (H&N EASI>=4), median H&N EASI improved from 5.4 at baseline to 2.4 and 0.8 at Wk16 and Wk52, respectively, and 0.4 at Wk152. Improvements in H&N region were comparable to overall EASI improvement. Conclusions Tralokinumab provided sustained improvements in the H&N regions in patients with moderate-to-severe AD for up to 4 years. Sustained improvements were also seen in patients with severe disease and substantial H&N involvement at baseline.",,,0007-0963,/10.1093/bjd/ljad498.051,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad498.051,
Efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab is maintained to two years in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction Lebrikizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to IL-13, thereby blocking the downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. The efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab have been investigated in a number of Phase 3 trials including: ADvocate1 (NCT04146363), ADvocate2 (NCT04178967), ADhere (NCT04250337), and ADjoin (NCT04392154). Lebrikizumab (with or without TCS) was efficacious in providing clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms of AD through Week(W) 52 in adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Objectives We report the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab (LEB) in the long-term extension study ADjoin (NCT04392154) following 104 weeks of continuous LEB treatment with and without TCS use. Methods Patients in ADvocate1&2 who achieved either EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 (without rescue) at W16 were re-randomized 2:2:1 to LEB250mg Q2W, LEB250mg Q4W, or placebo (LEB withdrawal). Patients who completed W52 of ADvocate1&2 were able to enroll in ADjoin. Patients in ADhere who achieved either EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 (without rescue) at W16 were able to enroll into ADjoin and Issue Section: Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Abstracts randomized 2:1 to LEB250mg Q2W or LEB250mg Q4W. Data are reported for patients originating from ADvocate1&2 and ADhere who received LEB250mg Q2W or Q4W in ADjoin. Efficacy outcomes were assessed based on all collected data (as observed analysis) up to 104W of LEB treatment. Safety was reported from ADjoin enrollment up to the data cut-off April 14, 2023. Results At W104, IGA 0/1 was maintained by 38/44 (86.4%; Q2W) and 42/55 (76.4%; Q4W) patients from ADvocate1&2 and 26/31 (83.9%; Q2W) and 11/14 (78.6%; Q4W) patients from ADhere. EASI 75 was maintained by 65/68 (95.6%; Q2W) and 77/80 (96.3% Q4W) ADvocate1&2 patients and 39/41 (95.1%; Q2W) and 24/25 (96.0%; Q4W) ADhere patients at W104. In patients who achieved EASI 75 at W16, EASI 90 was achieved by 56/68 (82.4%; Q2W) and 66/80 (82.5%; Q4W) ADvocate1&2 patients and 35/41 (85.4%; Q2W) and 18/25 (72.0%; Q4W) ADhere patients at 104W. During ADjoin, 166/267 (62.2%) patients from the subpopulations of ADvocate1&2 and ADhere who received LEB Q2W or Q4W in ADjoin reported adverse events (AEs), most of which were mild (31.5%, n=84) or moderate (27.0%, n=72) in severity. Serious AEs were reported by 10 (3.8%) patients. There was one death in the ADhere Q2W arm. Six (2.3%) patients reported AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. The safety profile of LEB in ADjoin is consistent with that observed during ADvocate1&2 and ADhere. Conclusions Efficacy outcomes were maintained long-term, over 2 years of continuous LEB treatment, in both LEB250mg Q2W and Q4W arms.

Lebrikizumab does not impact vaccine-induced immune responses: results from a phase 3 study in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction Lebrikizumab (LEB) is a monoclonal antibody (Ab) that has shown efficacy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in Phase 2/3 trials. LEB targets IL-13 and inhibits signaling of the IL-4Ralpha/IL-13Ralpha1 complex. The potential immunomodulator effect of LEB necessitates investigating its impact on immune responses. Objectives To report the seroresponses to the Tdap (Diphtheria/Tetanus Toxoids/Pertussis) and MCV (Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, and W-135)) vaccines in LEB-treated and placebo (PBO)-treated adult patients (aged 18-15 years) with moderate-to-severe AD; and to compare the efficacy of LEB vs PBO in the treatment of AD. Methods ADopt-VA was a US Phase 3, 16-week (W) randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled study to assess LEB impact on vaccine immune responses in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The primary endpoint was the immune response to 2 vaccines, the Tdap and MCV . LEB was given as a 500 mg loading dose at baseline and W2, followed by 250 mg LEB Q2W. At W12, both vaccines (Tdap and MCV) were administered to all patients, LEB group N=107, Placebo (PBO) group N=81. Immune responses were determined by Ab level differences between W12 and W16. Secondary efficacy endpoints at W16 were Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) scores. Results For Tdap, 73.6% of LEB patients had a positive Ab response vs 73.4% for PBO, 90% CI, 0.3 (-10.2, 11.2). For MCV, LEB patients had an 86.9% positive Ab response vs 75.0% for PBO, 90% CI, 12.2 (2.5, 22.0). IGA (0,1) was achieved by 40.6% of LEB patients vs 18.9% receiving PBO (p=<0.001); EASI 75 was achieved by 58.0% and 32.7% (p<0.001), respectively. The safety profile was consistent with previous LEB trials. Conclusions These data show that LEB does not negatively impact immune responses for Tdap or MCV vaccines in adults with moderateto-severe AD.",,,0007-0963,/10.1093/bjd/ljad498.004,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad498.004,
"Proteomic, miRNA and bacterial biomarker patterns in atopic dermatitis patients and their course upon anti-IL-4Ralpha therapy",,"Background: Identification of biomarkers is required for a systems medicine approach and personalized treatment in atopic dermatitis (AD). These biomarkers may not only aid in diagnosing but also might be suitable to predict the effectiveness of targeted treatment. Objective(s): We aimed to identify proteomic, microbial and miRNA biomarkers in AD patients and investigated their course in relation to the clinical response upon anti-IL-4Ralpha therapy. Method(s): Proteomic and miRNA screening was performed in AD patients in comparison to healthy controls. Differentially regulated serum proteins, miRNA and selected skin microbiota were measured consecutively in 50 AD patients before and upon systemic dupilumab treatment. A random forest classifier was used to predict the outcome of dupilumab therapy based on the initial biomarker patterns. Result(s): We identified 27 proteomic candidates, miRNA and three microbial strains to be dysregulated in AD. CCL17, CCL13, CCL22, E-selectin and BDNF were differently regulated and significantly associated with treatment response. In contrast, neither the microbial composition nor the miRNA pattern was associated with treatment response upon dupilumab treatment. Conclusion(s): AD patients display defined dysregulations regarding their systemic proteomic serum profile, miRNA patterns and their skin microbiome. The proteomic profile and selected skin bacteria changed profoundly upon anti-IL-4Ralpha therapy which was associated with an overall clinical response. This was not seen in miRNA-related biomarkers. Our findings support the hypothesis that biomarker profiles reflect treatment responses and may in the future be used to develop a personalized medicine approach for the treatment of AD patients.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Lebrikizumab Maintains Improvements in the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure Through 2 Years of Treatment in Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis,,"Rationale: Lebrikizumab treatment in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) improved patient-reported outcomes in the phase-3 trials ADvocate1&2 (monotherapy) through 52 weeks and ADhere (combination topical corticosteroids) through 16 weeks. We report the impact of lebrikizumab on AD signs/symptoms as reported by the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) at week 104 of continuous treatment in ADjoin, a long-term extension. Method(s): ADvocate1&2 16-week lebrikizumab responders (achieved EASI-75 or IGA 0/1) who were re-randomized to 250mg lebrikizumab every 2 or 4 weeks (Q2W or Q4W) for 36 weeks, continued the same treatment in ADjoin (52 additional weeks). ADhere 16-week lebrikizumab responders were randomized to Q2W or Q4W in ADjoin (88 additional weeks). POEM assesses patient-reported symptoms over the previous week; higher scores (range=0-28) indicate more severe disease; >=4-point change is clinically important. Result(s): For ADvocate1&2, mean POEM scores at 52 versus 104 weeks continuous lebrikizumab treatment were 6.0 versus 6.0 (Q2W); 7.0 versus 5.3 (Q4W). POEM=0/1 response rates were 20.7 versus 19.6% (Q2W); 18.2 versus 33.3% (Q4W). Patients reporting >=4-point improvement from parent-study baseline to 52 versus 104 weeks were 98.8 versus 100% (Q2W); 89.9 versus 96.3% (Q4W). For ADhere, mean POEM scores at 16 versus 104 weeks continuous lebrikizumab treatment were 8.8 versus 5.4 (Q2W); 7.3 versus 5.8 (Q4W). POEM=0/1 response rates were 12.5 versus 17.1% (Q2W); 10.3 versus 38.9% (Q4W). Patients reporting >=4-point improvement from ADhere baseline to 16 versus 104 weeks were 80.4 versus 94.3% (Q2W); 89.3 versus 83.3% (Q4W).

Dupilumab Reduction of IgE Levels and Probability of Atopic Dermatitis Flares - Analysis of A Randomized Placebo-Controlled 52-Week Study,,"Rationale: IgE levels are often elevated in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) but the clinical relevance of reducing IgE levels in patients with AD remains unclear. This analysis reports the impact of dupilumab treatment on total IgE levels in association with the probability of having flares in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): This analysis includes patients with moderate-to-severe AD from phase 3, double-blind study CHRONOS (NCT02260986), who were randomized to dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo in combination with topical corticosteroids for 52 weeks. Flares were defined in the protocol as worsening of the disease that required escalation/intensification of treatment. Result(s): 315 patients randomized to placebo and 106 patients randomized to dupilumab were included. Most patients treated with placebo had an increase in total IgE levels after 52 weeks (65% had an increased ratio change in total IgE from baseline), while most treated with dupilumab had a decrease in total IgE levels (81% with a ratio change reduction from baseline). The dupilumab-mediated reduction in total IgE corresponded with a reduced probability of having flares over 52 weeks, whilst with placebo an increase in total IgE levels was associated with an increased probability of having flares (parameter estimate [95%CI]=0.40 [-0.37 to 1.17];P=0.31 for placebo and 1.91 [0.13-3.69];P<0.05 for dupilumab). Conclusion(s): Patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with placebo show an increase in total IgE levels and in the probability of having flares over time, while patients treated with dupilumab show a decrease in total IgE levels, corresponding with a decreased probability of having flares.Copyright © 2023",Kim B.; Beck L.; Simpson E.; Eichenfield L.; Silverberg J.; Eyerich K.; Imafuku S.; Chen Z.; Rossi A.; Cyr S.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2023.11.070,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2023.11.070,

For the above article, Blauvelt et al, significant noncompliance at a study site was recently identified, and, as a result, 9 patients enrolled at that site should no longer be included in the analysis. After removing the 9 patients from the database, the data tables were regenerated and re-analyzed. The removal of these patients did not alter the findings or the overall conclusions; however, there are small numerical updates required for some data points. The article has been updated online. The following sentences in the original publication contain data from the original data set; the updated data provided in the text below reflect the revised data set with the 9 patients removed: In the Results section of the Abstract: Patients (n = 236) continuing upadacitinib maintained high levels of skin and itch response. Patients (n = 239) switching from dupilumab experienced additional incremental improvements in clinical responses within 4 weeks of starting upadacitinib. Under the ""Patients"" subhead: Among the 620 patients who completed week 24 of Heads Up, 475 entered the OLE; 236 continued to receive upadacitinib, and 239 switched from dupilumab to upadacitinib. Under the ""Safety"" subhead: In all patients who received at least 1 upadacitinib dose, the incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were 5.3 E/100 PY and 4.5 E/100 PY, respectively (Supplementary Table II and Supplementary Table III). The most common AEs (>10 E/100 PY) were acne (31.0 E/100 PY), worsening AD (21.2 E/100 PY), blood creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) increase (18.3 E/100 PY), and nasopharyngitis (13.2 E/100 PY). As summarized in Supplementary Table IV, the incidence of serious infections and opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis and herpes zoster) were low (1.9 E/100 PY and 1.6 E/100 PY, respectively). All herpes zoster cases were mild or moderate and involved a single dermatome; 1 patient experienced involvement of 2 dermatomes, and 2 patients experienced noncutaneous involvement (1 ophthalmic; 1 oticus [Ramsay Hunt syndrome]). Under the ""Efficacy with continuous upadacitinib"" subhead: Among patients receiving continuous upadacitinib, mean EASI improved from 30.7 at baseline to 2.5 at week 24 of Heads Up. In addition, 74.7% achieved EASI90, and 54.9% achieved WP-NRS of 0 or 1 (Fig 1). Concurrent achievement of EASI90 and WP-NRS of 0 or 1 was reached by 50.7%. Under the ""Efficacy with upadacitinib after switching from dupilumab"" subhead: Mean EASI improved with dupilumab from 29.1 at baseline to 3.2 at week 24 of Heads Up. After switching to upadacitinib, mean EASI further improved to 1.0 at week 16 of the OLE. EASI ranged from 0 to 10.8 and 98% of patients who switched from dupilumab to upadacitinib had EASI of <=7 at week 16 (Supplementary Fig 3, available via Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6h4gtrzgdc/). The proportion of patients who achieved EASI75 increased within 4 weeks of switching to upadacitinib from 87.9% to 98.7%, reaching 97.0% at week 16 of the OLE (Supplementary Fig 2). Furthermore, 49.4% achieved EASI100 within 4 weeks of switching to upadacitinib compared with 16.4% after 24 weeks with dupilumab. Itch improvement was observed with 83.3% of patients achieving DELTAWP-NRS of >=4 within 4 weeks of switching to upadacitinib compared with 63.3% of patients after 24 weeks of dupilumab (Supplementary Fig 2). Six (3.6%) of 167 patients who achieved WP-NRS of <=4 after 24 weeks of dupilumab did not maintain WP-NRS of <=4 at week 16 after switching to upadacitinib. Similar patterns were observed for WP-NRS: 21 (84.0%) of 25 and 43 (63.2%) of 68 patients who achieved WP-NRS of 4 and WP-NRS of 2 or 3 with dupilumab, respectively, then achieved lower WP-NRS scores after 16 weeks of upadacitinib. After 16 weeks of upadacitinib, 88.5% (23/26) of patients who had not achieved EASI75 after 24 weeks of dupilumab achieved EASI75; 65.2% of these patients achieved EASI90 but not EASI100 and 30.4% achieved EASI100 (Supplementary Fig 5, available via Mendeley at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6h4gtrzgdc/). Furthermore, 56.6% of patients who had not achieved DELTAWP-NRS of >=4 did so after 16 weeks of upadacitinib. Lower itch levels were achieved after 16 weeks of upadacitinib by 65.2% (30/46) of patients with WP-NRS of >4 after 24 weeks of dupilumab; 21.7% of these patients achieved WP-NRS of 0 or 1. Among 74 patients who did not achieve EASI90 after 24 weeks of dupilumab, 84.3% (95% CI, 75.8%-92.8%) achieved EASI90 after 16 weeks of upadacitinib and among 194 patients who did not achieve EASI100 after 24 weeks of dupilumab, 38.7% (95% CI, 31.7%-45.7%) achieved EASI100 after 16 weeks of upadacitinib.

Long-term treatment with tralokinumab normalizes the molecular gene signature of atopic dermatitis,,"Introduction: Interleukin (IL) 13 is a key driver of skin inflammation and barrier abnormalities in atopic dermatitis (AD). Tralokinumab is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes IL-13. Tralokinumab demonstrated efficacy and safety for AD treatment in pivotal phase 3 trials at week 16, and high levels of EASI-75 and IGA 0/1 response were sustained through 2 years of continued treatment. The impact of long-term tralokinumab treatment on the molecular phenotype of AD skin has not been previously assessed. We investigated the impact of IL-13 neutralization on skin biomarkers following 2 years of tralokinumab treatment in patients with moderate- to-severe AD in the phase 3 ECZTRA 1 (NCT03131648) trial and the long-term extension trial ECZTEND (NCT03587805). Method(s): Skin biopsies (n = 13 subjects) were collected from lesional (baseline, week 16, and week 104) and nonlesional skin (baseline and week 104). Gene expression levels of biomarkers related to inflammation and skin barrier integrity were assessed by RNA sequencing and validated by qPCR. Treatment differences were estimated by linear mixed-effect models with treatment and time as fixed effects and random effects for each patient. Result(s): Two years of tralokinumab treatment shifted the transcriptomic profile of lesional skin toward that of nonlesional skin; this shift was larger than that seen at week 16. These shifts included genes related to the Th2, Th17, and Th22 pathways as well as epidermal barrier. A strong shift was also observed in atherosclerosis signaling pathway genes. At 2 years, tralokinumab treatment also modified the transcriptomic profile of the nonlesional skin, improving the subclinical disease seen at baseline in normal-appearing skin. Conclusion(s): These shifts in the cutaneous biomarker profile highlight the role of IL-13 as a key driver of the AD molecular signature and support the role of targeted biologic therapy for long-term AD management.",Guttman-Yassky E.; Pavel A.; Kabashima K.; Staumont-Salle D.; Eyerich K.; Nahm W.; Pauser S.; Rosa J.C.D.; Ropke M.; Amoudruz P.; Blauvelt A.; Reich K.,,1539-6304,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&AN=639838451,

Long-term efficacy of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results from an open-label extension trial up to 5 years,,"Topical therapies often cannot sufficiently control moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Systemic immunosuppressants are not recommended for the long-term treatment of moderate-to-severe AD due to safety concerns. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, inhibiting the key drivers of type 2 inflammation. Data from the open-label extension (OLE) study, LIBERTY AD OLE, (NCT01949311) previously demonstrated acceptable safety and sustained efficacy of dupilumab in adult patients for up to 204 weeks (approximately 4 years). This study aims to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD up to 5 years (the end of this OLE study). Adults (>=18 years) with moderate-to-severe AD who had participated in any dupilumab parent study (phase 1 through phase 3) were enrolled into the long-term, multicenter OLE with a duration of up to 5 years. Initially, patients enrolled in the OLE were treated with 300-mg dupilumab weekly. In 2019, patients remaining in the study transitioned to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks in alignment with the approved dupilumab dose regimen. Concomitant treatments for AD were permitted, including topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Data are presented as observed for the overall study population (n = 2677). Of the 2677 patients who enrolled, 2207 completed treatment up to Week 52, 362 up to Week 172 and 334 up to Week 260. The most common reason for study withdrawals during the OLE study period was dupilumab approval and commercialization in the patient's country of enrollment [708 (51.3%)]. Fifty (1.9%) patients withdrew due to lack of efficacy. At the end of the study period, 88.9% of patients achieved a 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from parent study baseline (PSBL) and 76.2% of patients achieved a 90% reduction in EASI score from PSBL. At Week 260, 66.5% of patients achieved a >=4-point reduction in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score from PSBL. A total of 2276 (85.0%) patients reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and 101 (3.8%) patients discontinued treatment permanently due to reported adverse events. Dupilumab had an acceptable safety profile over 5 years of treatment. In this long-term (5 year/260 weeks) open-label study, dupilumab demonstrated robust efficacy substantiated by sustained improvement of AD signs and symptoms (including skin lesions and pruritus) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The safety profile was acceptable and consistent with the known safety profile observed in previous dupilumab placebo-controlled studies.",,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljad162.036,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad162.036,
Long-term efficacy of abrocitinib up to 96 weeks in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis stratified by age: a post hoc analysis of the JADE EXTEND phase 3 trial,,"Oral abrocitinib 200 and 100 mg once daily provided short-term efficacy in a dose-dependent manner over 12 or 16 weeks in various age groups of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). This study aims to evaluate the long-term efficacy of abrocitinib treatment for up to 96 weeks in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who enrolled in JADE EXTEND (NCT03422822). This planned interim analysis included adult patients from the JADE clinical trials MONO-1 (NCT03349060), MONO-2 (NCT03575871), COMPARE (NCT03720470) and DARE (NCT04345367) who subsequently enrolled into the ongoing phase 3 extension trial JADE EXTEND (data cutoff: September 25, 2021). Patients who were randomly assigned to abrocitinib 200 or 100 mg once daily in the qualifying trials continued to receive the same dose in JADE EXTEND with blinding maintained; those who received placebo were randomly assigned to abrocitinib 200 or 100 mg. All patients from JADE DARE received a known dose of abrocitinib 200 mg in JADE EXTEND. Patients previously randomly assigned to dupilumab in JADE DARE or JADE COMPARE were excluded from this analysis. Patients were grouped for analysis by age (18-50 years; >50 years) recorded at the screening visit of the respective qualifying trial. Assessments included the proportion of patients who achieved Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) with a >=2-grade improvement from baseline, >=75% and >=90% improvement from baseline on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75 and EASI-90), a score of <2 or a >=4-point improvement from baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score (PP-NRS 0/1 or PP-NRS4), and a score of <2 on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI 0/1). Data (as observed values) were evaluated up to 96 weeks of abrocitinib treatment. A total of 1309 patients [18-50 years (n = 1046); >50 years (n = 263)] were analysed. At Week 16 of abrocitinib treatment, patients achieved improvements with abrocitinib 200 or 100 mg in a dose-dependent manner in both age groups for IGA 0/1 [18-50 years, 55% (abrocitinib 200 mg)/34% (abrocitinib 100 mg); >50 years, 56%/38%], EASI-75 (79%/61%; 76%/69%) and PP-NRS4 (70%/51%; 76%/61%). Similar dose-dependent responses in both age groups were observed for the high-threshold clinical, patient-reported and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) endpoints of EASI-90 [18-50 years, 54% (abrocitinib 200 mg)/33% (abrocitinib 100 mg); >50 years, 59%/40%], PP-NRS 0/1 (35%/25%; 54%/30%) and DLQI 0/1 (38%/23%; 47%/24%). Regardless of age and dose, substantial proportions of patients were observed with responses at Weeks 24, 48 and 96 of abrocitinib treatment. At Week 96, dose-dependent responses remained for the younger subgroup of patients (including for high-threshold responses). For the older subgroup, responses were less clearly dose-dependent from Week 48. At Week 96, responder proportions were as follows: for IGA 0/1: 18-50 years, 55% (abrocitinib 200 mg)/44% (abrocitinib 100 mg); >50 years, 58%/51%; for EASI-75: 85%/73%, 89%/86%; for PP-NRS4: 66%/54%; 80%/79%; and for the high-threshold endpoints of EASI-90: 58%/45%; 73%/58%; for PP-NRS 0/1: 38%/26%; 44%/54%; and for DLQI 0/1: 41%/32%; 48%/51%. Regardless of age, substantial proportions of adults achieved clinical and patient-reported endpoints (IGA 0/1, EASI-75 or PP-NRS4) after short-term treatment with either abrocitinib dose. Similar trends were observed for high-threshold clinical, patient-reported and HRQoL endpoints (EASI-90, PP-NRS 0/1 or DLQI 0/1). Dose-dependent efficacy was observed short-term regardless of age, and up to 96 weeks in patients aged 18-50 years. Responder proportions of patients aged >50 years were less clearly dose-dependent from Week 48 of abrocitinib treatment. These findings may be informative for patients and healthcare providers when making treatment decisions. Further data from the ongoing JADE EXTEND trial may provide greater precision for long-term efficacy estimates.",,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljad162.043,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad162.043,
Lebrikizumab provides clinically meaningful improvements in atopic dermatitis in patients previously treated with dupilumab,,"Dupilumab is a treatment option for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Not all patients treated with dupilumab achieve and maintain clinically meaningful responses; some experience adverse events and some discontinue dupilumab for other reasons. For these patients, prospective data are needed to better understand the efficacy of systemic medications administered after discontinuation of dupilumab. Lebrikizumab (LEB) is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13, thereby blocking the downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. ADhere (NCT04250337) is a randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy of lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) over 16 weeks in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. The results of this study, previously reported, showed statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms of AD in patients treated with LEB plus TCS vs. placebo (PBO) plus TCS. Of the patients randomized to LEB plus TCS, 20 reported prior dupilumab exposure. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of LEB plus low to mid-potency TCS for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in the subpopulation of ADhere patients with prior exposure to dupilumab. At baseline, eligible patients in ADhere were randomized 2 : 1 to LEB 250 mg plus TCS or PBO plus TCS. Patients with prior exposure to dupilumab were permitted, with at least 8 weeks of washout prior to entering the study. Reported medical history was used to identify patients with prior exposure to dupilumab. Efficacy was measured through Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). ADhere analyses were performed on a modified population, excluding 17 patients (from a single study site) whose eligibility could not be confirmed. All analyses are descriptive summaries using post hoc, as-observed analyses. The Pruritus NRS analysis only includes patients with baseline values >=4. Observed results exclude data collected after use of rescue medication or treatment discontinuation. In ADhere, 211 patients were randomized 2 : 1 to LEB plus TCS (n = 145) or PBO plus TCS (n = 66). Of the patients randomized to LEB plus TCS, 20 reported prior dupilumab exposure. Of these 20 patients, the reason for dupilumab discontinuation was loss of response or inadequate response (10 patients), subject decision (four patients) or intolerance to medication (one patient). The final five patients discontinued due to affordability, treatment availability or unspecified reasons. In patients treated with LEB plus TCS, baseline disease characteristics were comparable between the overall LEB-treated population (n = 145) and the subpopulation with prior dupilumab exposure (n = 20). Of the 20 patients with prior dupilumab exposure, 13 patients presented with an IGA of three and seven patients presented with an IGA of 4. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] body surface area reported at baseline was 37.3 (15.7). The mean (SD) baseline scores for EASI and Pruritus NRS were 25.9 (8.1) and 7.8 (1.9), respectively. The mean (SD) duration since AD onset was longer in patients with prior dupilumab experience vs. the overall LEB-treated population 27.0 (22.5) vs. 21.0 (17.4) years, respectively]. In patients treated with LEB plus TCS, two of the 20 with prior dupilumab exposure were excluded due to use of rescue medication or treatment discontinuation. The IGA 0/1 with 2- point improvement was achieved by 6/18 patients, EASI 75 was achieved by 13/18 patients and Pruritus NRS 4-point improvement was achieved by 8/15 patients at Week 16. One patient reported rescue medication use. The results of this subpopulation analysis suggest that patients with prior dupilumab exposure can benefit from lebrikizumab treatment in combination with TCS. Additional data are needed to confirm this finding due to the small number of patients in the subpopulation.",,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljad162.010,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad162.010,
Patients maintain stable response with no or minimal fluctuations during treatment with lebrikizumab up to Week 52,,"Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13, thereby blocking the downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. ADvocate1 (NCT04146363) and ADvocate2 (NCT04178967) are identically designed phase 3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials evaluating lebrikizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). At Week 16 of both studies, lebrikizumab 250 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) showed statistically significant improvements in measures of skin clearance and patient reported outcomes. Patients treated with lebrikizumab achieved clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms of AD with fewer AD flares across multiple definitions than patients treated with placebo. In patients who met the protocol-defined criteria for response to lebrikizumab at Week 16, most patients treated with lebrikizumab Q2W and lebrikizumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) maintained an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 response (71% and 77%, respectively) and a 75% improvement in the Eczema and Severity Index from baseline (EASI 75; 78% and 82%, respectively) up to Week 52. The objective of this analysis is to determine the proportion and the individual efficacy trajectory of lebrikizumab-treated patients who exhibited a stable response with no or minimal fluctuations of efficacy from Week 16 to Week 52 in Week 16 responders. Patients who responded to lebrikizumab at the end of the 16- week induction period were rerandomized 2 : 2 : 1 to receive lebrikizumab Q2W, lebrikizumab Q4W or placebo Q2W (withdrawal) for 36 additional weeks. Week 16 responders were defined as those achieving an EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 with a >=2-point improvement and without rescue medication use. We defined no or minimal fluctuations as maintaining EASI 75 for at least 80% of the 10 study visits from Week 16 to Week 52. Separately, we analysed EASI 90 with the same criteria. We also analysed the proportion of patients who achieved each endpoint at all 10 maintenance period study visits. ADvocate2 analyses were performed on a modified population, excluding 17 patients who entered the maintenance period (from a single study site) and whose eligibility could not be confirmed. Therefore, analyses were performed on the modified pooled population of ADvocate1 and ADvocate2 patients. All analyses were performed post hoc. If patients used rescue medication, discontinued treatment or transferred to the escape arm, data collected at or after the event was imputed as nonresponse. In ADvocate1 and ADvocate2, 291 patients met the criteria for response at Week 16 (EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 with a >=2-point improvement and without rescue medication use) and were rerandomized to receive lebrikizumab Q2W (n = 113), lebrikizumab Q4W, (n = 118) or withdrawal (n = 60) from Week 16 to Week 52. The proportions of patients who maintained EASI 75 for at least 80% of the maintenance period were 71% (lebrikizumab Q2W), 71% (lebrikizumab Q4W) and 60% (withdrawal). The proportions of patients who maintained EASI 75 at all study visits were 53% (lebrikizumab Q2W), 55% (lebrikizumab Q4W) and 38% (withdrawal). The proportions of patients to achieve and maintain the more stringent response of EASI 90 for at least 80% of study visits were 45% (lebrikizumab Q2W), 51% (lebrikizumab Q4W) and 35% (withdrawal). In ADvocate1 and ADvocate2, approximately 7 out of 10 of patients who continued treatment with lebrikizumab maintained at least an EASI 75 response with no or minimal fluctuations. These individual patient data show that most patients treated with monotherapy lebrikizumab Q2W and Q4W maintain a stable response with no or minimal fluctuations of efficacy up to Week 52.",,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljad162.008,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljad162.008,

This study aims to report the effect of dupilumab treatment on signs, symptoms and quality of life in patients with atopic hand and foot dermatitis using dedicated clinical and patient reported instruments. The phase 3, randomized, double-blind LIBERTY-AD-HAFT (NCT04417894) trial enrolled patients >=12 years with moderate-to-severe [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 3/4] atopic hand and foot dermatitis.

Baseline serum biomarkers do not predict dupilumab treatment response in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Previous analyses based on short-term, phase 2 studies reported that baseline biomarkers do not correlate with clinical outcomes following dupilumab treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This new analysis based on 16-week, phase 3 studies reports whether pretreatment levels of common serum biomarkers can predict treatment response to dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and 2 (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769), two randomized, double-blind studies, included patients >=18 years-old with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or placebo for 16 weeks. Correlation between change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and log of baseline IgE, CC chemokine ligand 17 [CCL17; previously referred to as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)] and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline was assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho). At Week 16, change in EASI showed little correlation with baseline total IgE [Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) = -0.14, n = 370 for dupilumab; rho = -0.03, n = 202 for placebo], baseline CCL17 (rho = - 0.28, n = 369 for dupilumab; rho = -0.05, n = 201 for placebo) or baseline LDH (rho = -0.30, n = 370 for dupilumab; rho = -0.08, n = 202 for placebo). Overall safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

The proportions of new EASI-75 or EASI-90 responders were higher with abrocitinib vs dupilumab at weeks 2 (EASI-75: 29% [106/361] vs 21% [77/362]; EASI-90: 12% [42/361] vs 7% [26/362]) and 4 (42% [103/248] vs 24% [68/287]; 22% [70/312] vs 11% [36/338]), and were comparable between the 2 groups at week 26 (15% [5/33] vs 16% [11/67]; 13% [12/89] vs 15% [23/150]). The proportions of new responders for PP-NRS4 were higher with abrocitinib vs dupilumab at week 2 (48% [172/357] vs 26% [93/364]) and were comparable between the 2 groups at weeks 4 (25% [46/184] vs 25% [67/270]) and 26 (10% [7/67] vs 9% [8/89]). The proportions of never-responders were lower with abrocitinib vs dupilumab (EASI-75: 12% [42/362] vs 16% [60/365]; EASI-90: 25% [91/362] vs 36% [131/365]; PP-NRS4: 18% [63/357] vs 23% [82/364]). Early in the treatment, there were more new efficacy responders with abrocitinib than with dupilumab.

To evaluate EASI response and PROs in adolescents from ECZTRA 6 treated with tralokinumab 300mg for the full 52-week treatment period. Patients were randomized to tralokinumab 300mg Q2W (n = 97) or placebo (n = 94) for 16 weeks. At Week 16, patients initiated on tralokinumab and achieving primary endpoints (IGA 0/1 and/ or EASI-75) without rescue were re-randomized to tralokinumab 300mg Q2/4W monotherapy for 36 additional weeks; other patients were switched to open-label tralokinumab 300mg Q2W plus optional topical corticosteroids. Post-hoc analyses were conducted by pooling Week 16-52 data for all patients initially randomized to tralokinumab 300mg Q2W. Greater proportions of tralokinumab- vs placebo-treated patients achieved primary endpoints at Week 16; progressive improvement was seen through Week 52. In addition, pruritus NRS score was improved for a greater proportion of tralokinumab- vs placebo-treated patients from baseline to Week 16, with further improvement up to Week 52. Progressive improvements over time were also observed for proportions of patients with reductions of pruritus NRS >=4, POEM >=4, and CDLQI >=6, from baseline.

LB1702 Lebrikizumab does not impact vaccine-induced immune responses: Results from a phase 3 study in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Lebrikizumab (LEB) is a monoclonal antibody (Ab) that has shown efficacy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in Phase 2/3 trials. LEB targets IL-13 and inhibits signaling of the IL-4Ralpha/IL-13Ralpha1 complex. The potential immunomodulator effect of LEB necessitates investigating its impact on immune responses. ADopt-VA was a US Phase 3, 16-week (W) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess LEB impact on vaccine immune responses in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The primary endpoint was the immune response to 2 vaccines, the Tdap (Diphtheria/Tetanus Toxoids/Pertussis) vaccine and MCV (Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, and W-135)) vaccine. LEB was given as a 500 mg loading dose at baseline and W2, followed by 250 mg LEB Q2W. At W12, both vaccines (Tdap and MCV) were administered to all patients, LEB group N=107, Placebo (PBO) group N=81. Immune responses were determined by Ab level differences between W12 and W16. Secondary efficacy endpoints at W16 were Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) scores. For Tdap, 73.6% of LEB patients had a positive Ab response vs 73.4% for PBO, 90% CI, 0.3 (-10.2, 11.2). For MCV, LEB patients had an 86.9% positive Ab response vs 75.0% for PBO, 90% CI, 12.2 (2.5, 22.0). IGA (0,1) was achieved by 40.6% of LEB patients vs 18.9% receiving PBO (p=<0.001); EASI 75 was achieved by 58.0% and 32.7% (p<0.001), respectively. The safety profile was consistent with previous LEB trials. These data show that LEB does not negatively impact immune responses for Tdap or MCV vaccines in adults with moderate-to-severe AD.Copyright © 2023",Soung J.; Laquer V.; Merola J.F.; Forman S.; Elmaraghy H.; Meskimen E.; Hu C.; Natalie C.; Pierce E.; Torisu-Itakura H.; Gil E.; Jarell A.,,0022-202X,/10.1016/j.jid.2023.06.076,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexa&DO=10.1016%2fj.jid.2023.06.076,
43006 Dupilumab Improves Sleep in Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis over 24 Weeks,,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) often leads to night-time itching and scratching, causing sleep disturbance. The DUPISTAD (NCT04033367) study evaluated the impact of dupilumab treatment on sleep in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): DUPISTAD was a 24-week, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled phase 4 study. Patients were randomized 2:1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) to Week 24 (dupilumab-dupilumab, n=127), or placebo to Week 12 then dupilumab 300 mg q2w to Week 24 (PBO-dupilumab, n=61). Topical corticosteroids were permitted. Sleep Quality NRS (0-10, rescaled as 10 minus observed value), SCORAD Sleep VAS (0-10), and POEM Sleep Score (0-4) were assessed. Result(s): At Week 24, dupilumab-dupilumab and PBO-dupilumab groups had similar mean percentage change from baseline in Sleep Quality NRS (-57.2% and -57.0%, respectively), and mean changes from baseline to W24 in SCORAD Sleep VAS score (-5.5 and -5.3, respectively), and POEM Sleep score (-2.7 and -3.0, respectively). From Week 12 to Week 24, the PBO-dupilumab group showed rapid and marked improvements in Sleep Quality NRS (-32.4%), SCORAD Sleep VAS score (-3.0), and POEM Sleep score (-1.9). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 70.1% of dupilumab- dupilumab patients vs 75.4% of PBO-dupilumab patients; serious TEAEs occurred in 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively.

Dupilumab Treatment Leads to Rapid and Consistent Improvement of Atopic Dermatitis in All Anatomical Regions in Patients Aged 6 Months to 5 Years,,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is heterogeneous in distribution pattern and clinical features. This analysis assessed the effect of dupilumab on the extent and severity of AD across various signs (erythema, edema/papulation, excoriation, lichenification) in different anatomical regions (head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities) in patients aged 6 months to 5 years. Method(s): In LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial, children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab or placebo with concomitant low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. Changes in AD signs across anatomical regions were assessed using unweighted Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) body region scores. Result(s): Overall, 162 patients were randomized to dupilumab (n = 83) or placebo (n = 79). A significant improvement in least squares mean EASI area score was seen by week 2 in all four anatomical regions (P < 0.0001 for dupilumab vs. placebo) and sustained throughout treatment. Least squares mean EASI sign scores in erythema, excoriations, and infiltration/papulation showed significant improvement by week 2 in all regions (P < 0.001), while lichenification showed significant improvement in all regions by week 4 (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Dupilumab use with concomitant low-potency TCS treatment resulted in rapid and consistent improvement in AD signs in all anatomical regions, in patients aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD.

Laboratory safety from a 16-week phase III study of dupilumab in patients aged 6 months-5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Previous studies of dupilumab treatment in adults, adolescents and children aged 6-11 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) showed no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters. Here, we evaluate laboratory safety data for dupilumab-treated children aged 6 months-5 years with moderate-to-severe AD. In LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL (NCT03346434 part B), a placebo-controlled phase III trial, 162 children aged 6 months-5 years with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized to receive dupilumab 200 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks (n=83) based on baseline weight (200 mg: >=5 to <15 kg; 300 mg: >=15 to <30 kg), or placebo (n=79) for 16 weeks. Low-potency topical corticosteroids were initiated from day -14. At baseline mean (SD) haematology parameters were similar in both treatment groups: Eosinophils [dupilumab: 1.1x109 cells L-1 (0.7); placebo: 1.1x109 cells L-1 (0.7)], platelets [dupilumab: 397.7x109 cells L-1 (103.2), placebo: 385.6x109 cells L-1 (112.9)] and neutrophils [dupilumab: 3.54x109 cells L-1 (1.56); placebo: 3.85x109 cells L-1 (1.73)]. Mean (SD) counts of neutrophils [dupilumab: 3.18x109 cells L-1 (1.94) placebo: 3.79x109 cells L-1 (1.91)] remained within the normal reference interval (RI) at week 16. Mean (SD) change in platelet count at week 16 was -16.3x109 cells L-1 (78.5) in the dupilumab group and 17.4x109 cells L-1 (106.6) in the placebo group. In the dupilumab group, the mean (SD) change in eosinophil count increased at week 4 [0.48x109 cells L-1 (1.8)] and trended downward by week 16 [0.31x109 cells L-1 (1.4)], while minimal changes were noted in the placebo group at week 4 [0.1x109 cells L-1 (0.7)] and week 16 [-0.2x109 cells L-1 (0.7)].

Safety of Lebrikizumab in Adults and Adolescents with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: An Integrated Analysis of Eight Clinical Trials,,"Background: Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to interleukin (IL)-13, thereby blocking the downstream effects of IL-13 with high potency. Objective(s): To report integrated safety of lebrikizumab in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from phase 2 and 3 studies. Method(s): Five double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled studies; one randomized open-label study; one adolescent open-label, single-arm study; and one long-term safety study were summarized in two datasets: (1) placebo-controlled week 0-16 (All-PC Week 0-16) in patients who received lebrikizumab 250 mg every 2 weeks (LEBQ2W) versus placebo and (2) patients who received any dose of lebrikizumab at any time during the studies (All-LEB). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (IR)/100 patient-years (PY) are provided. Result(s): A total of 1720 patients received lebrikizumab (1637.0 PY exposure). In All-PC Week 0-16, the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between treatment groups; most events were nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. The most frequently reported TEAEs were atopic dermatitis (placebo) and conjunctivitis (LEBQ2W). Frequencies of conjunctivitis cluster were 2.5% (placebo) and 8.5% (LEBQ2W), and all events were mild or moderate (All-LEB 10.6%, IR, 12.2). Frequencies of injection site reactions were 1.5% (placebo) and 2.6% (LEBQ2W; All-LEB 3.1%, IR, 3.3). Frequencies of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were 1.4% (placebo) and 2.3% (LEBQ2W; All-LEB 4.2%, IR, 4.5).

Result(s): Baseline mean (standard error [SE]) imputed lichenification EASI sign scores in dupilumab/placebo groups were: head, 1.7 (1.0)/1.5 (1.0); trunk, 1.6 (0.9)/1.6 (0.8); upper extremities, 2.3 (0.6)/2.3 (0.7); lower extremities, 2.4 (0.6)/2.4 (0.7). At Week 16, least squares (LS) mean (SE) lichenification EASI sign scores for dupilumab/placebo were: head, 0.9 (0.1)/1.5 (0.1); trunk, 0.8 (0.1)/1.3 (0.1); upper extremities, 1.3 (0.1)/1.9 (0.1); lower extremities, 1.2 (0.1)/ 2.0 (0.1); P < 0.0001 for dupilumab versus placebo, all regions. Improvement in all regions was seen as early as Week 4 (P < 0.001 for dupilumab vs. placebo). Overall safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

"Dupilumab treatment results in rapid, sustained and clinically meaningful improvement in itch in patients aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis",,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by intense pruritus. Dupilumab treatment has demonstrated rapid onset of itch reduction in adults, adolescents and school-age children in previous phase 3 studies. Method(s): LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL (NCT03346434 part B) was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, during which children aged 6 months to 5 years were randomized 1:1 to dupilumab 200/300 mg + topical corticosteroids (TCS) every 4 weeks (q4w; n = 83), or placebo + TCS (n = 79). Caregiver-reported Daily and Weekly Worst Scratch/Itch NRS Scores (WSI-NRS; 0-10) were assessed from baseline to Week 16. Result(s): From Day 9, treatment with dupilumab 200/300 mg q4w + TCS significantly improved itch compared to placebo + TCS, as measured by LS mean percent change from baseline in Daily WSI-NRS (-16.8% vs. +8.0%; [P = 0.005]).

Efficacy of abrocitinib and dupilumab on chronic hand eczema in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Results from the Phase 3 JADE DARE study,,"Background: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) often have chronic hand eczema, a relapsing inflammatory disorder involving the skin of the hands. Abrocitinib, an oral once-daily selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, and dupilumab, an anti-IL4 receptor-alpha monoclonal antibody, are two systemic therapies approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. We evaluated the effects of abrocitinib and dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD with coexisting hand eczema. Method(s): Exploratory analyses were conducted for data from JADE DARE (NCT04345367), a double-blind Phase 3 trial of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 200mg abrocitinib (orally once daily) or 300mg dupilumab (subcutaneously once every 2 weeks). Patients received concomitant topical therapies to treat affected areas, including medium- or low-potency topical corticosteroids for active lesions. For patients with hand eczema, the subtype (allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, atopic, vesicular, or hyperkeratotic hand eczema, protein contact dermatitis/contact urticaria) was evaluated. The proportion of patients achieving a hand eczema Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a >=2-point improvement from baseline was assessed for the most affected hand over the 26-week treatment period. In addition, the extent of disease (finger/distal, finger/proximal, hand/dorsal, hand/ventral, wrist) and clinical signs (erythema, infiltration/papulation, vesicles, fissuring, scaling, edema) were evaluated for the most affected hand. Nominal P values were calculated for comparisons, which were not controlled for multiplicity. Result(s): Of 362 patients in the abrocitinib 200mg group and 365 patients in the dupilumab 300mg group, 267 (74%) and 265 (73%) patients, respectively, had hand eczema, with most patients having chronic hand eczema (abrocitinib: 256 [96%]; dupilumab: 244 [92%]), which is defined as lasting for more than three months or relapsing at least 2 or more times per year. The extent, clinical signs, and subtypes of chronic hand eczema were similar in the two groups. Atopic hand eczema was the most common subtype (abrocitinib: 87%; dupilumab: 90%) followed by irritant contact dermatitis (abrocitinib: 14%; dupilumab: 13%) and hyperkeratotic eczema (abrocitinib: 11%; dupilumab: 7%). As early as Week 2, the proportion of patients with chronic hand eczema who achieved an IGA score of 0/1 for the most affected hand was significantly greater with abrocitinib (22% [95% CI: 17-27]) than with dupilumab (14% [95% CI: 9-18]; P>=0.05) and continued to increase through week 26 (abrocitinib: 74% [95% CI: 68-80]; dupilumab: 62 percent [95% CI: 55-68]; P>=0.01). Conclusion(s): In patients with moderate-to-severe AD with coexisting chronic hand eczema, treatment with abrocitinib resulted in a greater proportion of patients achieving clear or almost clear skin on the most affected hand compared with patients treated with dupilumab; improvements with abrocitinib occurred rapidly and were sustained through 26 weeks. These results support the use of abrocitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had chronic hand eczema.",Bissonnette R.; Worm M.; Shi V.Y.; Zhang F.; Chan G.; Bratt T.; Kerkmann U.; Clibborn C.,,1941-2789,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641262576,
"Eblasakimab improves multiple disease measures in adult patients with moderateto- severe atopic dermatitis in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 study",,"Background: Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of atopic dermatitis (AD). Both signal through a shared type-2 receptor, a heterodimer comprised of IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha1. Eblasakimab, a first-in-class, fully human monoclonal antibody binds IL-13Ralpha1 with high affinity and blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13 through the type-2 receptor. A randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, Phase 1b multiple ascending dose monotherapy study [NCT04090229] evaluated the safety, tolerability, and clinical properties for eblasakimab vs. placebo in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Top line results have been reported previously (Blauvelt 2022, AAD). The objective of this study was to further analyze secondary endpoints of clinical relevance and posthoc subgroup analyses. Method(s): Three cohorts were randomized to receive 200, 400 or 600mg eblasakimab or placebo subcutaneously weekly for eight weeks in a multiple ascending dose study design. Adult participants had chronic AD present for three or more years before screening, and the following parameters at screening and baseline: eczema area and severity index (EASI) >=16, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score >=3, >=10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement. Rescue medication was not allowed. Efficacy assessments included percent change from baseline (%CFBL) in EASI, proportions of participants with 50 percent, 75 percent or 90 percent improvement in EASI score (EASI-50, EASI-75, EASI-90) or IGA 0/1, and %CFBL in percent BSA involvement. Inferential statistical analysis was performed for 600mg vs. placebo groups at Week 8 only. Result(s): Improvements in EASI score were seen early and progressed over the trial duration with eblasakimab treatment vs. placebo. Significant improvements in %CFBL in EASI score at Week 8 were noted for eblasakimab 600mg vs. placebo (-65% vs. -27%, P=0.014). The difference in adjusted means was apparent by Week 6. Improvements were observed in the proportions of participants taking eblasakimab vs. placebo who achieved EASI-50 (81% vs. 31%), EASI-75 (69% vs. 15%) and EASI-90 (38% vs. 15%) at Week 8. At Week 8 a higher percentage of participants achieved an IGA 0/1 for eblasakimab 600mg vs. placebo (44% vs. 15%, P=0.107); mean %CFBL in BSA was -51% vs. -13%, respectively. Rates of moderate-to-severe AEs were comparable between 600mg and placebo. AEs related to treatment were similar between groups. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were higher in the placebo group. One SAE was reported in the study considered unrelated to treatment. No deaths were reported. Conclusion(s): Eblasakimab was well tolerated with significant improvements vs. placebo in several efficacy outcomes in a Phase 1b study in adults with moderate-to-severe AD.",Veverka K.A.; Menezes J.; Thng S.; Gooderham M.; Simpson E.,,1941-2789,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641262571,
High-level responses across multiple domains in patients with atopic dermatitis treated with abrocitinib versus dupilumab: A post-hoc analysis of a Phase 3 randomized trial,,"Background: Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms that affect patients' quality of life (QoL). There is a need for effective therapies that can minimize multiple impacts of AD. Objective(s): Here, we examined the proportions of patients achieving high-level responses in two or three measures of treatment efficacy (skin clearance, reduction of itch, and improved QoL) with abrocitinib versus dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): This post-hoc analysis used data from JADE DARE (NCT04345367), a 26-week, randomized (1:1), Phase 3b, double-blinded, double-dummy trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral abrocitinib (200mg once daily) versus subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background medicated topical therapy. High-level responses were defi ned as achieving two or three of the following: <= 90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90), Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) score <2, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) <2. Result(s): Data were analyzed from 719 patients (abrocitinib, n=358; dupilumab, n=361). At Week 2, at least two high-level responses were achieved by 13 percent of abrocitinib-treated and 3 percent of dupilumab-treated patients; at Week 26, those proportions were 44 percent and 33 percent, respectively. Proportions of patients who achieved two or three high-level responses (EASI-90 + PPNRS <2 +/- DLQI <2; EASI-90 + DLQI <2 +/- PP-NRS <2; PP-NRS <2 + DLQI <2 +/- EASI-90) were larger with abrocitinib than with dupilumab, irrespective of domain combination: at Week 2, 5%-9% for abrocitinib and 0%-2% for dupilumab; at Week 26, 27%-33% for abrocitinib and 17%-22% for dupilumab. Proportions of patients achieving all three high-level responses at Week 2 were 4 percent (abrocitinib) and 0 percent (dupilumab); at Week 26, the proportions were 24 percent and 12 percent, respectively. Conclusion(s): Patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with abrocitinib were more likely to achieve at least two high-level responses, as early as Week 2, compared with patients treated with dupilumab. At Week 26, twice as many abrocitinib-treated patients achieved skin clearance, no itch, and no dermatologic impact on QoL as patients treated with dupilumab.",Armstrong A.W.; Blauvelt A.; Gooderham M.J.; Hong H.C.H.; Zhang F.; Feeney C.; Clibborn C.; Myers D.E.; Chan G.,,1941-2789,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&AN=641262601,
359 Switching from dupilumab to abrocitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: An analysis of responders and nonresponders to dupilumab,,"Abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily Janus kinase 1-selective inhibitor, had a superior efficacy vs. dupilumab in head-to-head randomized trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Data on patients who switched from dupilumab to abrocitinib have been limited. To evaluate abrocitinib response in patients with moderate-to-severe AD who were responders or nonresponders to dupilumab. Dupilumab-treated patients from the JADE DARE trial (NCT04345367), which was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of 26-week abrocitinib (200 mg daily) vs. dupilumab (300 mg bi-weekly) in patients receiving topical medicated therapy, had the option to switch to abrocitinib 200 mg by enrolling to an open-label JADE EXTEND trial (NCT03422822). In this analysis, we evaluated the response to abrocitinib 200 mg at week 12 of JADE EXTEND of responders and nonresponders to dupilumab at week 26 of JADE DARE. Response and nonresponse were defined as patients' achievement and nonachievement, respectively, of >=50%, >= 75% or >=90% improvement from the JADE DARE baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-50, EASI-75 or EASI-90), >= 4-point improvement from JADE DARE baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4), and PP-NRS score of 0 or 1 (PP-NRS 0/1) at week 26 of JADE DARE. In addition, changes in individual EASI and PP-NRS scores were evaluated in dupilumab-treated patients with significant skin lesions (EASI >=16) or itch burden (PP-NRS >=7) at week 26 of JADE DARE Patients who withdrew from JADE EXTEND were considered nonresponders after withdrawal. Additionally, adverse events (AEs) of dupilumab-treated patients from JADE DARE occurring during JADE EXTEND were assessed. Out of 365 dupilumab-treated patients in JADE DARE, 312 received treatment in JADE EXTEND. After 12 weeks of switching to abrocitinib, EASI-50 response was maintained in 98% of patients (277/282) who had attained EASI-50 after 26 weeks of dupilumab. Those values were 95% (232/245) for EASI-75, 88% (143/162) for EASI-90, 91% (192/210) for PP-NRS4 and 79% (86/109) for PP-NRS 0/1. Conversely, among patients who did not attain EASI-50 after 26 weeks of dupilumab, switching to abrocitinib for 12 weeks resulted in 75% (12/16) of patients attaining this level of response. Those values were 77% (41/53) for EASI-75, 62% (85/136) for EASI-90, 51% (46/90) for PP-NRS4 and 45% (86/192) for PP-NRS 0/1. Among dupilumab-treated patients with EASI >=16 at week 26 of JADE DARE, 91% (10/11) experienced improvements (i.e. EASI <16), after switching to abrocitinib for 12 weeks; in two such patients, score changes were consistent with >=97% improvement in EASI from JADE DARE week 26 to JADE EXTEND week 12 (from 45.5 to 0 and from 42.3 to 1.4). Among patients with PP-NRS >=7 at JADE DARE week 26, 75% (12/16) showed an improvement (i.e. PP-NRS score <7), 12 weeks after switching to abrocitinib; three such patients achieved a PP-NRS score of 0 or 1. During JADE EXTEND, 57% (178/312) of patients who previously received dupilumab experienced AEs and 3% (9/312) experienced serious AEs. Most patients with moderate-to-severe AD who switched from dupilumab to abrocitinib after 26 weeks maintained their response, while a great proportion of the nonresponders achieved clinically relevant efficacy outcomes 12 weeks after the switch. The safety profile of abrocitinib after switching from dupilumab was consistent with that of previous safety analyses; serious AEs were relatively rare.",Silverberg J.I.; Simpson E.L.; Thyssen J.P.; Pink A.E.; Weidinger S.; Chan G.; Lazariciu I.; Clibborn C.; Guler E.,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljac140.050,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljac140.050,
339 Dupilumab 16-week efficacy and safety are robust and consistent in adults over 60 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) may be more common than previously thought in adults aged >=60 years, a population underrepresented in clinical trials. Rigorous demonstration of efficacy and safety in older adults is clinically important due to distinct disease presentations in this group, age-related immune shifts, changes in drug metabolism and risks associated with a heightened burden of medical comorbidities and polypharmacy. Treatment options providing efficacy with acceptable safety profiles are of particular importance. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in patients aged >=60 years. Data were pooled from four randomized, placebo-controlled dupilumab trials in patients with moderate-to-severe AD (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 & 2 [NCT02277743, NCT02277769], LIBERTY AD CAFE [NCT02755649] and LIBERTY AD CHRONOS [NCT02260986]). Patients aged >=60 years (N =183) received dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw), every 2 weeks (q2w) or a placebo. Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) were permitted in LIBERTY AD CAFE and LIBERTY AD CHRONOS. Reported efficacy measures include the percentage of patients achieving a 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75), mean change in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) scores, and mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Safety data are also presented. Among patients aged >=60 years, significant increases in EASI-75 responses were observed in patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw (61.6%) and 300 mg q2w (63.0%) vs. placebo (14.3%; P < 0.0001 for both) at week 16. Least squares (LS) mean change (+/- standard error [SE]) in PP-NRS scores was significantly greater in patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw (-1.6 [0.2]) and 300 mg q2w (-1.7 [0.3]) vs. placebo (-0.9 [0.3]; P < 0.05 for both) at week 2. Improvements continued to week 16 in patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw (-4.0 [0.3]) and 300 mg q2w (-3.8 [0.3]) vs. placebo (-1.7 [0.3]; P < 0.0001 for both). Similarly, significant improvement (LS mean change [+/-SE]) in DLQI was seen in patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw (-5.0 [0.6]) and 300 mg q2w (-6.0 [0.7]) vs. placebo (-2.8 [0.6]; P < 0.01 vs. qw and P < 0.001 vs. q2w) at week 2; improvements continued to week 16 in patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw (-8.0 [0.6]) and 300 mg q2w (-9.65 [0.7]) vs. placebo (-3.3 [0.7]; P < 0.0001 for both). 52 (72.2%) patients in the 300 mg qw treatment group, 32 (58.2%) patients in the 300 mg q2w treatment group, and 40 (71.4%) patients in the placebo group experienced >=1 TEAE. The two most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were injection-site reactions (13.9%) and nasopharyngitis (9.7%) during 300 mg qw dupilumab treatment; dermatitis atopic (20.0%) and nasopharyngitis (5.5%) during 300 mg q2w dupilumab treatment; and dermatitis atopic (30.4%) and upper respiratory tract infection (7.1%) during placebo treatment. 3 (4.2%) patients during 300 mg qw dupilumab treatment and 2 (3.6%) patients during 300 mg q2w dupilumab treatment discontinued treatment permanently as a result of TEAEs. Dupilumab efficacy and safety profiles in patients aged >=60 years were generally consistent with that seen in patients aged <60 years with atopic dermatitis, and have been previously reported. Dupilumab, with or without TCS, improves AD signs, symptoms and quality of life with a consistent and acceptable safety profile in patients aged >=60 years with moderate-to-severe AD.",Silverberg J.I.; Lynde C.W.; Abuabara K.; Patruno C.; Benedetto A.D.; Khokhar F.A.; Marco A.R.; Levit N.A.,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljac140.033,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljac140.033,
338 Laboratory safety from a 16-week phase 3 study of dupilumab in patients aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Many systemic therapies used for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) have immunosuppressive properties and necessitate laboratory screening and monitoring, adding to the treatment burden. Previous dupilumab studies in adults, adolescents and children aged 6-11 years with moderate-to-severe AD showed no clinically meaningful adverse changes in laboratory parameters. Here we evaluate hematology and chemistry laboratory safety data for dupilumab-treated children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Patients aged 6 months to 5 years with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD were enrolled in LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL (NCT03346434 part B), a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 study. 162 patients were randomized to either dupilumab 200/300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w; N=83; baseline weight >=5 >=5 <15 kg: 200 mg; >=15 to <30 kg: 300 mg) or placebo (N = 79) for 16 weeks. From Day -14, all patients initiated standardized treatment with low-potency topical corticosteroids. Laboratory data was collected at baseline, weeks 4 and 16. At baseline, mean (SD) counts of hematology parameters were similar in both treatment groups: haemoglobin (dupilumab: 129.4 gL-1 [12]; placebo: 127.2 gL-1 [11.4]), lymphocyte (dupilumab: 4.6 x 109 L-1 [1.8]; placebo: 4.5 x 109 L-1 [1.7]), basophil (dupilumab: 0.07 x 109 L-1 [0.03]; placebo: 0.07 x 109 L-1 [0.04]), platelet (dupilumab: 397.7 x 109 L-1 [103.2]; placebo: 385.6 x 109 L-1 [112.9]) and eosinophils (dupilumab: 1.1 x 109 L-1 [0.7]; placebo: 1.1 x 109 L-1 [0.7]). Mean (SD) haemoglobin count in the dupilumab (128.4 x gL-1 [11]) and placebo groups (128.2 x gL-1 [11.2]), lymphocyte count in the dupilumab (4.20 x 109 L-1 [2.06]) and placebo groups (4.29 x 109 L-1 [1.52]) and basophil count in the dupilumab (0.07 x 109 L-1 [0.04]) and placebo groups (0.06 x 109 L-1 [0.03]) remained with the normal reference range for this population at week 16. The mean change (SD) in platelet count at week 16 was -16.3 x 109 L-1 (78.5) in the dupilumab group and +17.4 x 109 L-1 (106.6) in the placebo group. In the dupilumab treatment group, the mean eosinophil count increased at week 4 (mean change from baseline [SD]; + 0.48 x 109 L-1 [1.8]) and trended downward by week 16 (+0.31 x 109 L-1 [1.4]) while minimal changes were noted in the placebo group at week 4 (0.1 x 109 L-1 [0.7]) and week 16 (-0.2 x 109 L-1 [0.7]). The values for creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, albumin and protein at week 16 remained within the normal reference range in all treatment groups. Two patients in the dupilumab 200/300 mg q4w arm of this study reported treatment-emergent adverse events of severe and moderate eosinophilia. Neither event was asso-ciated with clinical symptoms nor led to the discontinuation of the study treatment. No clinically meaningful changes in hematology and chemistry parameters in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD were seen with 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment. These data demon-strate that, as with adults, adolescents and older children, routine laboratory monitoring is unnecessary in this younger population. Dupilumab was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.",Paller A.S.; Wollenberg A.; Siegfried E.C.; Gonzalez M.E.; Lockshin B.; Khokhar F.A.; Chen Z.; Gonzalez T.; Prescilla R.,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljac140.032,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljac140.032,
337 Dupilumab treatment is not associated with an increased overall risk of infections in patients aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have an increased risk of infection, including skin infections. Previous studies in children aged 6-11 years and adolescents showed that dupilumab is not associated with an increased risk of overall infections and is associated with a lower incidence of skin infections compared with a placebo. This post-hoc analysis reports the impact of dupilumab treatment on infections, including skin infections, in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD. In LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03346434, part B), children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD (Investigator's Global Assessment score >=3) were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab every 4 weeks (200 mg if baseline weight was >=5 to was >=5 to <15 kg, 300 mg if weight was >=15 to <30 kg) or placebo with concomitant low-potency topical corticosteroids for 16 weeks. Exposure-adjusted rates (patients with >=1 event per 100 patient-years [nP/100 PY]) and systemic anti-infective medication use (nP/100PY) were used to compare treatment groups. 162 patients were randomized to dupilumab (n = 83) or placebo (n = 79). During the 16-week treatment period, total infections rates were numerically lower in the dupilumab-treated group (nP/100PY: 185.2) compared with the placebo-treated group (nP/100PY: 245.7). Fewer infections of skin-structure and soft tissues were reported in the dupilumab group (nP/100PY: 24.7) compared with the placebo group (nP/100PY: 40.2). Dupilumab-treated patients had significantly lower rates of non-herpetic skin infections (nP/100PY: 42.7) than placebo-treated patients (nP/100PY: 92.7; P < 0.05 vs. placebo). There was no significant difference in rates of herpetic skin infections between the dupilumab (nP/100PY: 20.0) and placebo groups (nP/100PY: 17.1; P = 0.817 vs. placebo). No helminthic infections were reported in either group. Systemic anti-infective medication use was signif-icantly less frequent in the dupilumab group (nP/100PY: 104.7) compared with placebo (nP/100PY: 203.0; P < 0.05 vs. placebo). The overall safety of dupilumab was consistent with the known safety profile. Dupilumab treatment is associated with lower overall infections and significantly lower non-herpetic skin infections than placebo in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD.",Siegfried E.C.; Cork M.J.; Arkwright P.D.; Wollenberg A.; Eichenfield L.F.; Ramien M.; Khokhar F.A.; Chen Z.; Zhang A.; Cyr S.L.,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljac140.031,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljac140.031,
332 Improvement in symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) and AD-related quality of life with dupilumab treatment in adults: 24-week results of the DUPISTAD study,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic disease characterized by sleep disturbance, associated with night-time itching and scratching, along with skin pain, resulting in daytime drowsiness, diminished daytime productivity and overall reduced quality of life (QoL) in patients with AD. To report the effect of up to 24 weeks of dupilumab treatment on the QoL of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD, using data from the DUPISTAD (NCT04033367) study. Phase 4, a randomized DUPISTAD study, comprised two 12-week periods: an initial placebo-controlled double-blind period, and a subsequent 12-week open-label extension (OLE) period. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD (Eczema Area and Severity Index score >=12, Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale [NRS] score >=3, Sleep Disturbance NRS average score >=5), showing an inadequate response to topical treatments, were randomized 2:1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) for both the double-blind and OLE periods or placebo for the initial double-blind period, followed by dupilumab 300 mg q2w for the OLE period. The use of concomitant topical corticosteroids was permitted during the entire course of the study. Endpoints, including Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM; scored 0-28, with higher values indicating a worse outcome), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; scored 0-30, with higher values indicating a poorer QoL), Skin Pain and Sensitivity NRS (scored 0-10, where 0=no pain/normal sensitivity and 10=worst possible pain/ extremely sensitive) were assessed from baseline to week 24. The enrolled patients also completed a Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI-AD), including an NRS rating of the AD-Affected Ability to do Regular Daily Activities other than a Job (scored 0-10, where 0='no effect' and 10='prevented me from doing my daily activities'). Formal statistical comparisons were not performed on the data resulting from the OLE period. The DUPISTAD study enrolled a total of 188 patients: 127 patients received dupilumab throughout (dupilumab-dupilumab group), and 61 patients received a placebo and then switched to dupilumab (placebo-dupilumab group). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced. Improvement from baseline in AD-related patient-reported QoL indicators and AD symptoms was observed at week 24 in both groups, as illustrated by the mean change from baseline in POEM total scores (-14.6 in the dupilumab-dupilumab group and -15.9 in the placebo-dupilumab group), DLQI scores (-12.6 in the dupilumab-dupilumab group and -13.4 in the placebo-dupilumab group), Skin Pain NRS scores (-4.7 in the dupilumab-dupilumab group and -5.0 in the placebo-dupilumab group), Skin Sensitivity NRS scores (-4.6 in the dupilumab-dupilumab group and -5.0 in the placebo-dupilumab group), and the WPAI-AD NRS of Ability to do Regular Daily Activities scores (-4.2 in the dupilumab-dupilumab group and -3.8 in the placebo-dupilumab group). The placebo- dupilumab group experienced most of this improvement during the OLE period, as illustrated by the mean change from week 12 to week 24 in POEM total score (-11.5), DLQI score (-5.5), Skin Pain NRS score (-3.0), Skin Sensitivity NRS score (-3.0) and the WPAI-AD NRS of Ability to do Regular Daily Activities score (-2.0). The safety profile of dupilumab was consistent with the known safety profile. Dupilumab provided sustained improvements through 24 weeks in AD-related patient-reported measures of QoL and AD symptoms in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Patients who were switched from placebo to dupilumab at week 12 showed rapid improvement in these parameters after the switch, eventually matching the improvement achieved by patients who received dupilumab from baseline through week 24.",Merola J.F.; Chiou A.S.; During E.; Costanzo A.; Foley P.; Ardeleanu M.; Wu J.; Ozturk Z.E.,,1365-2133,/10.1093/bjd/ljac140.027,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1093%2fbjd%2fljac140.027,
"Laboratory safety from a 16-week, phase 3 study of dupilumab in patients aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis",,"Introduction (contexte de la recherche): Many systemic therapies used for atopic dermatitis (AD) necessitate laboratory screening and monitoring. Objectif: To report laboratory parameters in children (6 months-5 years) with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab (DPL). Methodes: LIBERTY AD INFANT/PRE-SCHOOL (NCT03346434 part B), a randomized, double-blind placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 3 study enrolled patients (pts; 6 months-5 years) with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD. In total, 162 pts received DPL 200/300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w; n = 83; 200/300 mg: baseline (BL) weight >= 5 - < 15 kg/>= 15 - < 30 kg) or PBO (n = 79) for 16 weeks (wks). All pts initiated standardized treatment with low-potency topical corticosteroids from day-14. Lab data were collected at BL, wks 4 and 16. Resultats: BL mean (SD) counts of hematology parameters were similar in both treatment arms: hemoglobin (DPL: 129 g/L [12]; PBO: 127 g/L [11.4]), leukocyte (DPL: 10.1 x 109/L [3.1]; PBO: 10.3 x 109/L [3.1]), platelet (DPL: 397.7 x 109/L [103.2]; PBO: 385.6 x 109/L [112.9]), and eosinophils (DPL: 1.1 x 109/L [0.7]; PBO: 1.1 x 109/L [0.7]). At Wk16, mean (SD) hemoglobin count with DPL (128.4 g/L [11]) and PBO (128.2 g/L [11.2]), and leukocyte counts with DPL (9.5 x 109/L [4]) and PBO (9.8 x 109/L [3.2]) remained within normal reference ranges for this population. Mean change (SD) in platelet count at Wk16 was -16.3 x 109/L (78.5) with DPL and +17.4 x 109/L (106.6) with PBO. Mean eosinophil count increased at Wk4 (mean change from BL [SD]; +0.48 x 109/L [1.8]) and trended downward by Wk16 (+0.31 x 109/L [1.4]) with DPL, with minimal changes noted with PBO (Wk4: 0.1 x 109 [0.7]; Wk16: -0.2 x 109 [0.7]). Creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen remained within normal reference ranges at Wk16. Two pts with DPL reported treatment emergent adverse events of severe and moderate eosinophilia; neither was associated with clinical symptoms or led to discontinuation of study treatment.

804 Upadacitinib normalizes the lesional and nonlesional cutaneous transcriptome in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"We evaluated the effect of upadacitinib 30 mg (UPA), a selective JAK1 inhibitor, vs dupilumab 300 mg (DUPI) on atopic dermatitis (AD)-associated cutaneous transcriptomic profiles in adults with moderate-to-severe AD enrolled in Heads Up (NCT03738397), a phase 3b, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Lesional (LS) and nonlesional (NL) skin biopsies were collected at baseline (BL), week (wk) 2, and wk16 and analyzed by RNA-sequencing. Using 3 AD datasets, a core AD transcriptome was defined as 808 genes differentially expressed in LS vs NL skin, representing 28 AD-associated pathways. At wk2, more AD-associated genes in LS skin were normalized to NL skin with UPA (800/808, n=12) vs DUPI (464/808, n=15), and fully normalized to NL skin by wk16 [UPA (808/808, n=6); DUPI (807/808, n=7)]. Overall, 16 and 10 of 28 AD pathways in LS skin were normalized to NL skin by 2-fold with UPA vs DUPI at wks2 and 16, respectively. In LS skin, T- and helper T-cell infiltration were reduced by UPA at wk16 vs BL (P<.01), with reductions in Th2 cells at wk2 (P<.01); UPA significantly normalized skin barrier gene expression (wound healing [P<.01], epidermal cell differentiation [P<.05]) vs BL at wk2, further enhanced at wk16 (P<.01); skin infection (Staphylococcus aureus) and itch (Neuroinflammation [NI], Neuron CREB Signaling) gene expression were significantly reduced by UPA vs BL at wks2 and 16 (S aureus, CREB, P<.05; NI, P<.01). DUPI did not significantly normalize expression of T-cell, skin barrier, skin infection, or itch pathways in LS skin vs BL until wk16 (P<.05), with a dampened effect relative to UPA. Strikingly, in NL skin, UPA but not DUPI further normalized expression of T-cell, skin barrier, skin infection, and itch gene signatures at wk16 relative to BL NL skin. In summary, UPA normalizes cutaneous gene expression dysfunction rapidly and more profoundly than DUPI in LS and NL skin from patients with moderate-to-severe AD.Copyright © 2023",Smith K.M.; Chen X.; Tsoi L.C.; Bi Y.; Gudjonsson J.; Parmentier J.,,0022-202X,/10.1016/j.jid.2023.03.814,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.jid.2023.03.814,

Dupilumab provides long-term efficacy over 2.5 years in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic disease requiring longterm management. Many traditional treatments for moderateto- severe AD are not recommended for long-term use due to safety concerns and limited data on efficacy from controlled trials. We report the long-term efficacy (2.5 years) of dupilumab in patients who optimally responded to monotherapy at week 16 of SOLO 1/2 and subsequently enrolled in SOLOCONTINUE for an additional 36 weeks of monotherapy, followed by 76 weeks in an open-label extension (OLE) study with optional concomitant topicals. We present data for adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with 300 mg dupilumab monotherapy every 2 weeks (q2w) or weekly (qw) in SOLO 1/2 (NCT02277743/NCT02277769) who achieved a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and/or an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 at week 16 and were re-randomized to continuing q2w (n = 73), continuing qw (n = 81) or placebo (n = 75) for an additional 36 weeks in SOLOCONTINUE (NCT02395133), followed by 76 weeks of 300 mg qw in the OLE (NCT01949311). At week 52 of monotherapy treatment with dupilumab, most patients who continued on dupilumab maintained an IGA score of 0/1 or EASI 75 (88% of patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 86% of patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw) vs. about half (49%) of patients who transitioned to placebo at week 16 (P < 0.0001 for both q2w and qw vs. placebo). In the OLE, almost all patients transitioning from dupilumab 300 mg q2w to qw (97%) and all patients continuing dupilumab 300 mg qw sustained their response of IGA 0/1 or EASI 75 through week 128. Almost all patients re-randomized to placebo in SOLO-CONTINUE who transitioned to dupilumab 300 mg qw in OLE achieved IGA 0/1 or EASI 75 within the first month of retreatment and maintained their response through week 128 (93%). Overall, fewer than half of patients who moved to OLE applied topicals (< 30% of those previously treated with dupilumab). Long-term treatment with dupilumab was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with observations in SOLO 1/2. Patients achieving optimal response at week 16 in SOLO 1/2 demonstrated sustained response over 36 weeks in SOLO-CONTINUE and an additional 76 weeks on dupilumab 300 mg qw in OLE.

Lebrikizumab Decreases Inflammatory Biomarkers in Patients with Asthma: Data from Randomized Phase 3 Trials (LAVOLTA I and II),,"Rationale: Lebrikizumab (LEB) was studied for treating immune mediated disorders, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. LAVOLTA I (NCT01867125) and II (NCT01868061) (LI&LII) were duplicate randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 LEB trials in uncontrolled asthma that enrolled subjects irrespective of asthma exacerbation history, baseline blood eosinophilia, or FeNO. LI&II failed to show consistently significant results in asthma exacerbation rate reduction. Here, effects of LEB on inflammatory biomarkers were assessed in patients with asthma. Method(s): Serum samples were tested using immunoassays for periostin (IL-13 activation marker), CCL13 (driver of chemotaxis in immune cells), CCL17 (driver of chemotaxis in Th2 cells), and IgE (hallmark of allergic inflammation). Mean changes from baseline in these markers are reported and change from baseline comparisons were evaluated using MMRM with different contrasts. Within-biomarker multiplicity controls were performed. Result(s): In LI, for 125mg LEB Q4W (N=359) vs placebo Q4W (N=362) at week 1, reductions from baseline were -35.6 vs -1.7 pg/mL for CCL13; -59.3 vs -4.6 pg/mL for CCL17; and -5.3 vs -1.2 ng/mL for periostin; and week 12 reductions from baseline were -49.5 vs -8.8 IU/mL for IgE. Differences with 125mg LEB Q4W were significant (p <0.0001), differences with placebo were not. Similar reductions were seen for LEB 37.5mg Q4W and for LII. Reductions were maintained during the 52-week LI&LII treatment periods. Conclusion(s): LEB treatment decreased inflammatory biomarkers in asthma. Reductions in circulating inflammatory biomarkers were observed as early as 1 week following a single LEB dose. Improvements in inflammation were maintained during 52 weeks of LEB treatment.Copyright © 2022",Szefler S.; Corren J.; Silverberg J.; Okragly A.; Sun Z.; Natalie C.; Zitnik R.; Siu K.; Blauvelt A.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2022.12.609,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2022.12.609,

Dupilumab Reduces Inflammatory Biomarkers in Patients Aged 6 Months to 18 Years With Moderate-to-Severe or Severe Atopic Dermatitis,,"Rationale: Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers are observed in atopic dermatitis (AD). Dupilumab is associated with reduction of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers in adults, but data from adolescent and pediatric patients are lacking. Method(s): We report type 2 and general inflammatory biomarker serum levels (LDH, TARC/CCL17, total IgE) from patients with moderate-to-severe or severe AD (the latter in patients aged 6-11 years) enrolled in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies receiving: dupilumab 200/300mg every 4 weeks (q4w) + topical corticosteroids (TCS; n=83), or placebo+TCS (n=79) (0.5-5 years; NCT03346434 part B); dupilumab 100/200mg q2w + TCS (n=122), or 300mg q4w + TCS (n=122), or placebo+TCS (n=123) (6-11 years; NCT03345914); and dupilumab 200/300mg q2w (n=82), or dupilumab 300mg q4w (n=84), or placebo (n=85) (12-17 years; NCT03054428). Result(s): Reduction in median percentage change from baseline in TARC/CCL17 (pg/mL) and LDH (U/L) was significantly higher in all dupilumab-treated arms across age groups (P<0.0001 at Week 16). Reduction in median change from baseline at Week 16 in total IgE (kU/L) was higher in dupilumab-treated patients than placebo for ages 0.5-5 (difference in median change [95%CI]: -2201.1 [-4497, -902.8], P<0.0001); 6-11 (-2338 [-3391,-1473] and -1888 [-2949, -1038], both P<0.0001) and 12-17 years (-2524 [-3579, -1783.6] and -1996.6 [-3260, -1308], both P<0.0001). Conclusion(s): Dupilumab treatment in patients aged 6 months to 18 years with moderate-to-severe or severe AD reduces levels of type 2 and general inflammatory biomarkers, reflecting reduction of systemic general and type 2 inflammation.Copyright © 2022",Beck L.; Muraro A.; Boguniewicz M.; Chen Z.; Levit N.; Marco A.R.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2022.12.473,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed25&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2022.12.473,
"Laboratory Safety of Dupilumab, and Its Effect on Inflammatory Biomarkers, in Chinese Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: An Analysis of a Randomized, Double-Blind Phase III Study",,"Objective: Limited information is available on the use of dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) in the Chinese population. Method(s): We analyzed laboratory data from a previously published randomized, double-blind phase III trial (NCT03912259) to provide further insight into the safety of dupilumab in Chinese adults with moderate to severe AD. The trial participants received either 300 mg of dupilumab or placebo every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. Hematology, blood chemistry, serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) were evaluated. Result(s): In total, 82 participants received dupilumab and 83 received placebo. With the exception of eosinophil counts of >0.8 x 109/L, which were found less frequently with dupilumab (9.8%) than with placebo (18.7%), the hematology and blood chemistry values were generally stable in both treatment groups. There were no clinically significant differences between the dupilumab and placebo groups, and no participants developed treatment-emergent abnormalities of potential clinical significance. However, compared with placebo, greater decreases in serum lactate dehydrogenase (mean change, -97.4 vs. -33.5 IU/L), TARC (median percent change, -78.6% vs. -30.8%), and total IgE (median percent change, -53.4% vs. -0.2%) were observed with dupilumab than placebo at week 16. Conclusion(s): Dupilumab demonstrated a favorable laboratory safety profile in Chinese adults with moderate to severe AD.Copyright © 2022 International Journal of Dermatology and Venereology.

"Safety of tralokinumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II and phase III trials*",,"Background: Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the activity of interleukin-13, a key pathogenic driver of atopic dermatitis (AD). Clinical trials including adults with moderate-to-severe AD, of up to 52 weeks' duration, showed tralokinumab was efficacious and well tolerated. Objective(s): To characterize the safety profile of tralokinumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): Safety and laboratory measures were assessed in pooled analyses of phase II and III placebo-controlled clinical trials of tralokinumab in moderate-to-severe AD (NCT02347176, NCT03562377, NCT03131648, NCT03160885, NCT03363854). Result(s): In total, 2285 patients were randomized in the initial treatment periods up to 16 weeks (1605 tralokinumab, 680 placebo). The frequencies of any adverse event (AE) were 65.7% for tralokinumab and 67.2% for placebo. The respective rates were 640 and 678 events per 100 patient-years of exposure (ep100PYE); rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-1.1. Serious AEs occurred in 2.1% of patients with tralokinumab and 2.8% with placebo (7.4 and 11.9 ep100PYE; rate ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.2). The most common AEs occurring at a higher frequency and rate with tralokinumab vs. placebo were: viral upper respiratory tract infection (15.7% vs. 12.2%; 65.1 vs. 53.5 ep100PYE); upper respiratory tract infection (5.6% vs. 4.8%; 20.8 vs. 18.5 ep100PYE); conjunctivitis (5.4% vs. 1.9%; 21.0 vs. 6.9 ep100PYE); and injection-site reaction (3.5% vs. 0.3%; 22.9 vs. 4.0 ep100PYE). Some events in safety areas of interest occurred at a lower frequency and rate with tralokinumab vs. placebo: skin infections requiring systemic treatment (2.6% vs. 5.5%; 9.7 vs. 22.8 ep100PYE), eczema herpeticum (0.3% vs. 1.5%; 1.2 vs. 5.2 ep100PYE), opportunistic infections (3.4% vs. 4.9%; 13.0 vs. 21.3 ep100PYE) and serious infections (0.4% vs. 1.1%; 1.3 vs. 3.7 ep100PYE). AEs did not increase with continued maintenance and open-label treatment, including rates of common or serious AEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation. No clinically meaningful changes in mean laboratory measures were observed with treatment up to 1 year. Conclusion(s): Across the AD population pool from five clinical trials, tralokinumab was well tolerated, with consistent safety findings during treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The safety profile during prolonged tralokinumab treatment was consistent with that during the initial treatment period; the frequency of events did not increase over time. What is already known about this topic? Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes interleukin-13, a key cytokine driving skin inflammation and epidermal barrier dysfunction in atopic dermatitis (AD). In clinical trials in moderate-to-severe AD, tralokinumab provided significant and early improvements in the extent and severity of AD and was well tolerated, with an overall safety profile comparable with placebo over 52 weeks. What does this study add? We report the frequency and rate of adverse events (AEs) from pooled observations of over 2000 patients from five phase II and phase III placebo-controlled clinical trials of tralokinumab in moderate-to-severe AD. During initial treatment up to 16 weeks, the frequencies of any AE and of serious AEs were similar for tralokinumab and placebo. AE rates did not increase with continued treatment up to 52 weeks. Common AEs occurring more frequently with tralokinumab vs. placebo were viral and upper respiratory tract infection, conjunctivitis and injection-site reaction. Some events occurred at a lower frequency and rate with tralokinumab vs. placebo, such as skin infections requiring systemic treatment, eczema herpeticum and opportunistic and serious infections. No clinically meaningful changes in mean laboratory measures were observed.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"Tralokinumab Efficacy and Safety, with or without Topical Corticosteroids, in North American Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: A Subanalysis of Phase 3 Trials ECZTRA 1, 2, and 3",,"Introduction: In pivotal phase 3 tralokinumab monotherapy (ECZTRA 1/2) and topical corticosteroid (TCS) combination (ECZTRA 3) trials in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), tralokinumab significantly improved signs and symptoms of AD. Geographic region may impact treatment response due to potential differences in race and ethnicity, and based on findings in other therapy areas. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab in the ECZTRA 1/2/3 North American population at week 16, as well as maintenance of responses over time, and compared these data side-by-side with those of the ECZTRA 1/2/3 non-North American population. Method(s): Primary endpoints were Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (IGA 0/1; clear or almost clear) or at least 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. At week 16, tralokinumab-treated IGA 0/1 or EASI-75 responders were re-randomized 2:2:1 to tralokinumab 300 mg q2w, or q4w, or placebo (ECZTRA 1/2) and 1:1 to tralokinumab 300 mg q2w or q4w (ECZTRA 3). Result(s): Overall, 559/1596 (35%) and 160/380 (42.1%) patients randomized in ECZTRA 1/2 and ECZTRA 3 were from North America, respectively. At week 16, IGA 0/1 and EASI-75 response rates were greater with tralokinumab versus placebo in ECZTRA 1/2 (IGA 0/1: 25.3% vs 15.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0, 17.3; p = 0.012; EASI-75, 40.1% vs 19.4%; 95% CI 12.6, 28.7; p < 0.001) and ECZTRA 3 (IGA 0/1, 40.0% vs 25.9%; 95% CI - 0.5, 28.3; p = 0.074; EASI-75: 58.1% vs 37.0%; 95% CI 4.9, 37.0; p = 0.012) and tralokinumab was well tolerated in the North American population. Patients with IGA 0/1 or EASI-75 response at week 16 demonstrated sustained responses at week 52 and week 32 in ECZTRA 1/2 and ECZTRA 3, respectively. Similar findings were observed in the non-North American trial populations. Conclusion(s): Tralokinumab, with or without TCS, displayed similar efficacy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe AD across the North American population, and was comparable to the non-North American population.

Prospects of using the genetically engineered preparation dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the adult population,,"Background Currently, the genetically engineered drug dupilumab, which was recently registered in Russia and is planned for use, is widely used in the world for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.. Objective Possibility of use of the genetically engineered drug dupilumab for the treatment of atopic dermatitis among adult population. Methods To address the issues of treatment tactics in patients with atopic dermatitis, a 12-week placebo-controlled study of its effectiveness was carried out on two control groups of 45 people each, divided into three subgroups of 15 people (1 subgroup - placebo; subgroup 2 - dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously 1 time in 2 weeks; subgroup 3 - dupilumab 200 mg subcutaneously 1 time per week). Evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment of atopic dermatitis with the targeted drug dupilumab was carried out using the following scales: EASI, IGA, NRS, SCORAD, POEM, DLQI, HADS. Results The results of the study show a significant improvement in the symptoms and manifestations of atopic dermatitis according to the SCORAD, EASI-70 and POEM scales. All patients taking dupilumab showed cleansing of the skin, a decrease in the intensity of pain and skin itching, which contributes to an improvement in the quality of life of patients with atopic dermatitis (a decrease in the DLQI value from 12-14 to 6-7), as well as a decrease in the level of anxiety and stress. At the same time, the number of side effects that occur in patients taking dupilumab and placebo is comparable. Conclusion Based on the study and the results of earlier studies of the effectiveness of targeted therapy of atopic dermatitis with the genetically engineered drug dupilumab, it is possible to recommend a regimen for the use of this drug registered in the Russian Federation for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the adult population: the initial dose of the drug is 600 mg, then 300 mg every 2 weeks with the regular use of moisturizers 2 times a day during the entire period of treatment. In the case of a protracted severe course of the disease, a weekly subcutaneous injection of the drug at a dose of 200-300 mg is possible.Copyright © 2022 Pakistan Association of Dermatologists.

Dupilumab Treatment Reduces Hospitalizations in Adults With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis,,"Background: Refractory disease, flares, or infections in atopic dermatitis (AD) can lead to hospitalizations. Objective(s): To compare hospitalization rates among adults with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab versus control. Method(s): Data from 7 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks [q2w] and/or weekly [qw]; with or without topical corticosteroids) were analyzed. Result(s): Patients in the dupilumab 300 mg q2w, qw, and combined dupilumab (q2w and qw; n = 1,841) groups compared with patients in the control group (n = 1,091) had lower rates of all-cause hospitalizations (5.8, 2.7, and 3.8 events, respectively, vs 9.0 events per 100 patient-years [PY]; all P < .05 [49%, 71%, and 62% risk reduction, respectively]); AD-related hospitalizations (2.0, 0.4, 1.0 events vs 4.1 events per 100 PY; P < .05 for qw and dupilumab combined [91% and 79% risk reduction, respectively]); as well as reduced overall duration of AD-related hospitalization (10.9, 7.3, and 8.6 d vs 38.9 d per 100 PY). Conclusion(s): Among adults with moderate-to-severe AD, treatment with dupilumab versus control was associated with significant reductions in all-cause and AD-related hospitalization rates, and shorter duration of AD-related hospitalization.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",Silverberg J.I.; Rubini N.P.M.; Pires M.C.; Rossi A.B.; Zhang A.; Chen Z.; Levit N.A.; Chao J.; Shumel B.; Bego-Le Bagousse G.,,2213-2198,/10.1016/j.jaip.2021.11.034,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed24&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaip.2021.11.034,
Rapidity of Improvement in Signs/Symptoms of Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis by Body Region with Abrocitinib in the Phase 3 JADE COMPARE Study,,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) can affect multiple body regions and is especially burdensome when involving exposed skin areas. Rapid, effective treatment of AD across body regions remains an unmet need, particularly for difficult-to-treat areas such as the head and neck area. We investigated the temporal and regional patterns of clinical improvement in AD with the use of abrocitinib, an orally available Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor under development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): We performed a post hoc analysis of data from JADE COMPARE, a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib 200 mg once daily, abrocitinib 100 mg once daily, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, and placebo in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who were concomitantly receiving medicated topical therapy. Assessments included the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index. Result(s): With abrocitinib 200 mg, time to >= 75% improvement in EASI (EASI-75) occurred at a median of 29 days across body regions, including the head and neck region. With abrocitinib 100 mg, EASI-75 response was achieved at a median of 30-32 days for the trunk and lower limbs, and at 56-57 days for the head and neck region and upper limbs. With dupilumab, EASI-75 response was achieved at a median of 43 days for the trunk and 57 days for other regions. EASI body region scores significantly improved with abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg versus placebo at week 2 (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Improvements with abrocitinib were maintained up to week 16. Conclusion(s): Rapid and persistent improvement in AD across all body regions was observed with abrocitinib treatment. Abrocitinib may be useful in patients with AD that affects difficult-to-treat anatomical areas or who require a rapid response. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03720470.

Dupilumab provides rapid and sustained improvement in SCORAD outcomes in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: combined results of four randomized phase 3 trials,,"Background: Dupilumab, a first-in-class therapy targeting the two key cytokines involved in the persistent underlying inflammatory pathway in atopic dermatitis (AD), is approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in Europe, USA, Japan and several other countries. Objective(s): To assess dupilumab effects on SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) and component scores (objective and subjective SCORAD) over time in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): This post hoc analysis included 2,444 patients in four placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trials. SOLO 1 and 2 (NCT02277743; NCT02277769) evaluated 16 weeks of dupilumab monotherapy against placebo. CAFE (NCT02755649) and CHRONOS (NCT02260986) evaluated dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) against TCS alone for 16 and 52 weeks, respectively. Result(s): 2,444 patients randomized to treatment in SOLO 1 and 2 (N = 1,379), CAFE (N = 325) and CHRONOS (N = 740) were analyzed. Dupilumab treatment significantly improved overall SCORAD and individual components as early as Week 1 or 2, with significant and clinically meaningful differences vs. control through end of treatment (p <.0001). These results occurred irrespective of dupilumab regimen, 300 mg subcutaneously weekly or every 2 weeks.

417 Dupilumab Significantly Improves Sleep Disturbance in Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: Results of the DUPISTAD study,,"DUPISTAD (NCT04033367) evaluated the impact of dupilumab on sleep. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD (EASI >=12, Pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) >= 3 and sleep NRS >=5) were randomized 2:1 to dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for 12 weeks (W12); both groups were permitted concomitant topical corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoint was sleep quality percentage change from baseline to W12, assessed by 11-point sleep NRS. Secondary endpoints included percent change in peak pruritus NRS, change in SCORing AD (SCORAD), SCORAD sleep visual analog scale (VAS), EASI and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System sleep-impairment SF8a score (PROMIS-T). 127 patients received dupilumab 300mg q2w and 61 placebo. Mean baseline SCORAD was 64.7 vs 62.9, and EASI 26.2 vs 26.0 (dupilumab vs placebo). Sleep NRS significantly improved in dupilumab-treated patients at W12 vs. placebo (LSMD -15.1%; p<0.001). Peak pruritus NRS (LSMD-28.6%, p<0.001), SCORAD (LSM -14.4, p<0.001), SCORAD sleep VAS (LSMD-2.3, p<0.001), and PROMIS-T Score (LSMD-3.6, p=0.001) improved significantly with dupilumab vs placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurred in 52.8% in the dupilumab group vs 62.3% with placebo. Four TEAEs (dupilumab: 3[2.4%]; placebo: 1[1.6]%) resulted in study discontinuation.

409 EASI p-EASI: predicting disease severity in atopic dermatitis patients treated with tralokinumab,,"Numerous targeted treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) are currently under investigation in clinical trials. Comparability of the efficacy of new drugs is therefore becoming more important. Serum biomarkers may offer an objective outcome measure for disease severity in AD. A combination of serum biomarkers TARC, IL-22, and sIL-2R as a signature (predicted EASI) may offer an objective measurement tool for disease severity in AD patients treated with topical steroids, cyclosporin A, or dupilumab. To validate the predicted EASI (p-EASI) in AD patients treated with tralokinumab in a clinical trial setting. Serum samples were collected from 198 patients with moderate to severe AD in the Phase 3 ECZTRA 1(NCT03131648) trial. Patients were randomized (3:1) to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300mg(n=149), or placebo(n=49) every other week for 16 weeks. Disease severity was assessed by EASI, and serum was collected at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment. Serum biomarkers TARC, IL-22, and sIL-2R were measured by Luminex. EASI and p-EASI scores highly correlated in tralokinumab treated patients(r=.59, P<.0001). In patients treated with tralokinumab, median EASI and p-EASI decreased from 30.9(IQR, 22.5-42.3) and 32.9(IQR, 25.6-40.2), respectively, to 13.5(IQR, 6.6-22.5) and 24.8(IQR, 20.6-59.0) after 16 weeks of treatment. In the placebo group, median EASI and p-EASI were 31.1 (IQR, 22.5-40.4) and 31.3(IQR, 25.0-37.5), respectively, at baseline; 19.0(IQR, 10.2-29.1) and 29.2(IQR, 25.5-32.5) after 16 weeks. These findings suggest that p-EASI may better reflect accurate effects of treatment. The biomarker signature p-EASI correlated with disease severity in moderate-severe AD patients treated with tralokinumab in a clinical trial setting. The use of objective biomarkers such as p-EASI may be considered as a tool to objectively assess treatment effect of new drugs for AD.Copyright © 2022",Olydam J.; de Wijs L.; Dik W.; Ropke M.; Da Rosa J.C.; Hijnen D.,,0022-202X,/10.1016/j.jid.2022.09.422,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1016%2fj.jid.2022.09.422,
"Efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate-tosevere atopic dermatitis: A phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ADhere)",,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing, heterogenous skin disease with a global prevalence of 2-10% in adulthood (Weidinger S, Beck LA, Bieber T et al. Atopic dermatitis. Nat Rev Dis Primers 2018; 4: 1; Barbarot S, Auziere S, Gadkari A et al. Epidemiology of atopic dermatitis in adults: results from an international survey. Allergy 2018; 73: 1284-93) and > 20% in children. Lebrikizumab, a novel high-affinity monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin 13, is being considered for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab vs. placebo in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD in the phase III ADhere study (NCT04250337). Eligible patients included adults (>= 18 years) and adolescents (>= 12 years and weighing >=40 kg) with moderate-to-severe AD. During the 16-week treatment period, 228 patients were stratified and randomized 2: 1 to treatment with either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at baseline and week 2) plus TCS (LEB 250 mg + TCS) or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks plus TCS (PBO + TCS). The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0/1 at week 16 and the proportion of patients achieving 75% improvement in EASI from baseline (EASI-75) at week 16. Key secondary endpoints were assessed at week 16 and included the percentage of patients achieving 90% improvement in EASI from baseline (EASI-90); the percentage change in EASI from baseline; the Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) >= 4-point improvement score and the Pruritus NRS percentage change from baseline; the percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS score of >=4 points at baseline who achieved both EASI-75 and >= 4-point reduction in Pruritus NRS score from baseline; the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) >= 4-point improvement score; and the change from baseline in Sleep-loss score, measuring interference of itch on sleep. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events, serum chemistry, haematology and urinalysis laboratory evaluations, physical examination and vital signs. In ADhere, 17 patients from a single site were excluded from analyses due to good clinical practice issues. Thus, efficacy and safety analyses were conducted for 211 patients. At week 16, Investigator's Global Assessment 0/1 was achieved by 41.2% (n = 60/145) of patients receiving LEB 250 mg + TCS vs. 22.1% (n = 15/66) receiving PBO + TCS (P = 0.011). Similarly, there was a significantly higher (P < 0.001) proportion of patients achieving EASI-75 for LEB 250 mg + TCS (69.5%) vs. PBO + TCS (42.2%), and EASI-90 (41.2% vs. 21.7%; P < 0.008). In addition, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in the percentage change in EASI from baseline for the LEB 250 mg + TCS vs. PBO + TCS group (-76.8 vs. -53.1). A higher proportion of those receiving LEB 250 mg + TCS achieved >=4 points reduction in Pruritus NRS score at week 16 vs. PBO + TCS (50.6% vs. 31.9%; P = 0.017) and a significant percentage change from baseline (P = 0.017) was observed in the LEB 250 mg + TCS group compared with the PBO + TCS group for the Pruritus NRS at week 16 (-50.7 vs. -35.5). Patients receiving LEB 250 mg + TCS had a significantly greater combined EASI-75 and Pruritus NRS score at week 16 compared with the PBO + TCS group (38.3% vs. 16.8%; P = 0.005). Furthermore, those receiving LEB 250 mg + TCS achieved significant DLQI >=4-point improvement vs. PBO + TCS group (77.4% vs. 58.7%; P = 0.036). A significant change from baseline in Sleep-loss score was also observed in patients receiving LEB 250 mg + TCS compared with PBO + TCS (-1.1 vs. -0.8; P = 0.025). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >=2% in either treatment group were conjunctivitis, headache, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, atopic dermatitis, dry eye and upper respiratory tract infection. Conjunctivitis (4.8% vs. 0%), headache (4.8% vs. 1.5%), hypertension (2.8% vs. 1.5%) and dry eye (2.1% vs. 0%) were more frequently reported in the LEB 250 mg + TCS group than in the PBO + TCS group. Nasopharyngitis (2.1% vs. 6.1%), atopic dermatitis (2.1% vs. 4.5%) and upper respiratory tract infection (0.7% vs. 3.0%) were less commonly reported in the LEB 250 mg + TCS group than in the PBO + TCS group. Serious adverse events were similar in the PBO + TCS group (1.5%) and the LEB 250 mg + TCS group (1.4%). In the LEB 250 mg + TCS group, sinus node dysfunction or arrhythmias (0.7%) and fall (0.7%) were reported. In the PBO + TCS group, dehydration (1.5%) and acute kidney injury (1.5%) were reported. The LEB 250 mg + TCS group did report adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (2.1%), which included injection site rash (0.7%), drug hypersensitivity (0.7%) and conjunctivitis (0.7%).

"Efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Results from two phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials",,"Lebrikizumab, a high-affinity IgG-4 monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-13, selectively prevents the formation of the IL-13Ra1/IL-4Ra heterodimer receptor signalling complex. Lebrikizumab demonstrated rapid, dose-dependent efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in a phase IIb trial (NCT03443024). Here, we report 16-week efficacy and safety outcomes of lebrikizumab monotherapy in patients with AD from two ongoing 52-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III trials - ADvocate1 (NCT04146363) and ADvocate2 (NCT04178967). Eligible patients with moderate-to-severe AD [adults and adolescents (12-17 years of age, weighing >=40 kg)] were randomized 2: 1 to subcutaneous lebrikizumab 250 mg or placebo every 2 weeks. Efficacy analyses included proportions of patients achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 and Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) >= 4-point improvement from baseline (P >= 4) at week 16. Nonefficacy-related missing data were imputed by multiple imputation. In ADvocate1, proportions of patients treated with lebrikizumab 250 mg (n = 283) and placebo (n = 141) achieving IGA 0/1 at week 16 were 43.0% and 12.8% (P < 0.001); EASI-75 responses were 59.3% and 16.4% (P < 0.001); P >= 4 proportions were 46.3% and 12.7% (P < 0.001), respectively.

Long-term safety and efficacy of tralokinumab in more than 1400 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis treated for up to 42 months: An interim analysis of ECZTEND,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin disease, negatively impacts on quality of life and often persists throughout a patient's lifespan. Few long-term treatments are currently available for patients with moderate-to-severe disease, presenting a need for options with a positive risk-benefit profile.

Br J Dermatol 2021; 184: 450-63]. An ongoing, open-label, 5-year extension trial, ECZTEND (NCT03587805), is evaluating the safety and efficacy of treatment with subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (plus optional corticosteroids) after a 600-mg loading dose in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who completed previous tralokinumab parent trials. We performed an interim analysis of ECZTEND to assess the safety and efficacy of tralokinumab for up to 42 months of total tralokinumab treatment (<= 2.5 years of which was in the open-label extension ECZTEND and <= 1 year in parent trials). The primary endpoint is the number of adverse events (AEs) during the treatment period from baseline to week 268. Secondary endpoints were defined as Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear) and > 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at prespecified weeks. This interim safety analysis included 1442 patients from the parent trials who had received >=1 dose of tralokinumab as of data cutoff (30 April 2021). Fifty-eight per cent of patients were male (median age 38.0 years) and median age of onset of AD was 3.0 years. Median duration of AD was 27.0 years, and median body surface area affected at parent-trial baseline was 46.0%. Median time from last dose of study drug in parent trial to first dose in ECZTEND was 34.0 days. Overall, 1127 patients (78.2%) reported experiencing an AE, with 101 patients (7.0%) reporting serious AEs (SAEs). The most frequent AEs (>= 5% by MedDRA preferred term) were viral upper respiratory tract infection, AD, upper respiratory tract infection, headache and conjunctivitis. In addition, 2.5% of patients reported injection site reaction, two patients (0.1%) reported eosinophilia, 38 (2.6%) reported herpes simplex virus infection and 30 (2.1%) reported herpes zoster. Most AEs (66.3%) were of mild severity. AEs led to withdrawal from ECZTEND in 34 patients (of these two were due to conjunctivitis and two due to allergic conjunctivitis). No conjunctivitis events were SAEs. No deaths were reported. In patients who reached the 2-year time point (week 104), or would have reached that time point had they not discontinued earlier (prior to the data cutoff of 30 April 2021), EASI-75 was achieved by 77.6% of patients and IGA 0/1 was achieved by 46.4% of patients. Worst weekly pruritus numeric rating scale <=3 was achieved by 54.4% of patients, and Dermatology Life Quality Index <=5 was achieved by 68.8% of patients, by modified nonresponder imputation.

High-level responses across multiple domains in patients with atopic dermatitis treated with abrocitinib versus dupilumab: A post-hoc analysis of a phase III randomized trial,,"Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms that affect patients' quality of life (QoL). There is a need for effective therapies that can minimize multiple impacts of AD. The objective was to examine the proportions of patients achieving high-level responses in two or three measures of treatment efficacy (skin clearance, reduction of itch and improved QoL) with abrocitinib vs. dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This posthoc analysis used data from JADE DARE (NCT04345367), a 26-week, randomized (1: 1), phase IIIb, double-blinded, double- dummy trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral abrocitinib (200 mg once daily) vs. subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background medicated topical therapy. Highlevel responses were defined as achieving two or three of the following: >= 90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90); Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PPNRS) score < 2; Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) < 2. Data were analysed from 719 patients (abrocitinib, n = 358; dupilumab, n = 361). At week 2, at least two high-level responses were achieved by 13% of abrocitinib-treated and 3% of dupilumab-treated patients; at week 26, those proportions were 44% and 33%, respectively. Proportions of patients who achieved two or three high-level responses (EASI- 90 + PP-NRS < 2 +/- DLQI <2; EASI-90 + DLQI <2 +/- PPNRS < 2; PP-NRS < 2 + DLQI <2 +/- EASI-90) were larger with abrocitinib than with dupilumab, irrespective of domain combination: at week 2, 5-9% for abrocitinib and 0-2% for dupilumab; at week 26, 27-33% for abrocitinib and 17-22% for dupilumab. Proportions of patients achieving all three high-level responses at week 2 were 4% (abrocitinib) and 0% (dupilumab); at week 26, the proportions were 24% and 12%, respectively (Figure 1). Patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with abrocitinib were more likely to achieve at least two high-level responses, as early as week 2, than patients treated with dupilumab. At week 26, twice as many abrocitinib-treated patients achieved skin clearance, no itch and no dermatological impact on QoL as patients treated with dupilumab.

Method(s): This analysis reports hematology parameters from patients aged 6 months to 17 years with moderate-to-severe AD who participated in any of three randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 16-week, phase three studies: LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL (6 months to 5 years; NCT03346434 Part B), LIBERTY AD PEDS (6-11 years; NCT03345914), and LIBERTY AD ADOL (12-17 years; NCT03054428). Patients in LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL were treated with either dupilumab 200/300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) + topical corticosteroids (TCS; n = 83) or placebo + TCS (n = 79). In LIBERTY AD PEDS, patients were treated with dupilumab 100/200 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) + TCS (n = 122), 300 mg q4w + TCS (n = 120), or placebo + TCS (n = 120). In LIBERTY AD ADOL, patients were treated with dupilumab 200/300 mg q2w (n = 82), dupilumab 300 mg q4w (n = 83), or placebo (n = 85). Data for all dupilumab treatment groups were pooled for the LIBERTY AD PEDS (N = 242) and LIBERTY AD ADOL (N = 165) studies. Result(s): At baseline in each age group, mean counts for platelets, neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils were similar between the dupilumab and placebo treated patients.

Dupilumab treatment shows rapid and consistent improvement in atopic dermatitis in all anatomical regions in patients aged 6 months to 5 years,,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is heterogenous in distribution pattern. It can affect any anatomic site, and shifts in affected sites can be seen over time. In young children, this may present as localized severe disease, including on the face and neck. Method(s): In LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03346434, part B), children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD (Investigator's Global Assessment score >=3) were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab every 4 weeks (q4w; 200 mg if baseline weight >=5 to <15 kg, 300 mg if >=15 to <30 kg) or placebo with concomitant low-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) for 16 weeks. Improvement in AD signs across anatomical regions was assessed using unweighted Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) body region scores (range 0-72). Result(s): 162 patients were randomized to dupilumab (n = 83) or placebo (n = 79). Baseline mean (standard error [SE]) imputed EASI body region scores in the dupilumab/placebo groups were: head, 28.8 (18.1)/24.5 (15.5); trunk, 29.7 (16.3)/27.8 (15.1); upper extremities, 40.3 (15.7)/38.2 (14.7); and lower extremities, 41.3 (17.3)/40.6 (15.4). At Week 16, the least squares (LS) mean (SE) unweighted EASI body region scores in the dupilumab/placebo groups were: head, 11.0 (1.9)/25.3 (1.9); trunk, 9.5 (1.8)/25.2 (1.9); upper extremities, 13.9 (2.2)/33.9 (2.3); and lower extremities, 14.6 (2.2)/35.3 (2.3); p < 0.0001 for dupilumab vs placebo, all regions. Improvement in all regions was seen as early as Week 2 (p < 0.0001 for dupilumab vs placebo). LS mean EASI area scores and EASI sign (erythema, excoriations, infiltration/papulation, and lichenification) scores also showed a significant improvement at Week 16 (p < 0.0001 for dupilumab vs placebo).

Dupilumab treatment is not associated with an increased overall risk of infections in patients aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Background: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) present an increased risk of infections, including skin infections. Previous studies in children aged 6 to 11 years and adolescents showed that dupilumab is not associated with an increased risk of overall infections and is associated with lower risks of skin infections compared with placebo. Here we report the impact of dupilumab treatment on infections, including skin infections, in children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): In LIBERTY AD PRESCHOOL, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03346434, part B), children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe AD (Investigator's Global Assessment score >=3) were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous dupilumab every 4 weeks (200 mg if baseline weight was >=5 to <15 kg, 300 mg if weight was >=15 to <30 kg) or placebo with concomitant low-potency topical corticosteroids for 16 weeks. Exposure-adjusted rates (patients with >=1 event per 100 patient-years [nP/100PY]) and percentage of patients with >=1 skin infections were used to compare treatment groups. Result(s): 162 patients were randomized to dupilumab (n = 83) or placebo (n = 79). During the 16-week treatment period, total infections rates were numerically lower in the dupilumab-treated group (nP/100PY: 185.2) compared with the placebo-treated group (nP/100PY: 245.7). Rates of fungal infections were not significantly different with dupilumab (nP/100PY: 0) than with placebo (nP/100PY: 4.2; p = 1.0 vs placebo). Bacterial infections were significantly less frequent in dupilumab-treated (nP/100PY: 3.9) than placebo-treated patients (nP/100PY: 45.6; p < 0.05 vs placebo). There was no significant difference in viral infections rates between the dupilumab (nP/100PY: 64.8) and placebo group (nP/100PY: 55.2; p = 0.681 vs placebo). No helminthic infections were reported in either group. The percentage of patients with >=1 skin infections was numerically lower in the dupilumab group (12.0%) than in the placebo group (24.4%).

34599 Achieving incrementally greater skin improvement thresholds with upadacitinib versus dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD): Heads Up study results,,"AD is a chronic, symptomatic, inflammatory skin disease that can affect patients' quality of life (QoL). Greater improvements in QoL have been observed with deeper improvements on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). In the Heads Up study, 692 adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1 to oral upadacitinib 30 mg once-daily or subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every other week. Degree of skin improvement was compared using proportions of patients achieving >=50%, >=75%, >=90%, and 100% EASI improvement from baseline (EASI-50, EASI-75, EASI-90, EASI-100). Distribution of improvement was assessed by mutually exclusive categories of EASI improvement thresholds from baseline (EASI<50%EASI-50-<75%EASI-75-<90%EASI-90-<100%EASI-100%). Distributions were descriptively compared and computed by sequentially calculating differences in EASI-100%EASI-90-<100%EASI-75-<90%EASI-50-<75% proportions; the differences were aggregated to determine the total proportion of patients achieving an incrementally greater response threshold. Proportions of patients achieving skin improvement were greater for upadacitinib versus dupilumab at week 16 for EASI-50 (79.3% versus 72.1%), EASI-75 (71.0% versus 61.1%), EASI-90 (60.6% versus 38.8%), and EASI-100 (27.9% versus 7.6%).

33558 Dupilumab significantly improves sleep disturbance in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Results of the DUPISTAD study,,"Background: Sleep disturbance, a prominent symptom of atopic dermatitis (AD), primarily related to nighttime itching/scratching, leads to insomnia, daytime fatigue/drowsiness, reduced productivity, and impaired quality of life. The DUPISTAD phase-IV randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study (NCT04033367) evaluated the impact of dupilumab on sleep. Method(s): Adults with moderate-to-severe AD (Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI]>=12, Pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) >= 3 and sleep NRS >=5) were randomized 2:1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for 12 weeks (W12); both groups were permitted concomitant topical corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoint was sleep quality percentage change from baseline to W12, assessed by 11-point sleep NRS. Secondary endpoints included percent change in peak pruritus NRS, change in SCORing AD (SCORAD), SCORAD sleep visual analog scale (VAS), EASI and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System sleep-impairment SF8a score (PROMIS-T). Result(s): 127 patients received dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 61 placebo. Mean baseline SCORAD was 64.7 vs. 62.9, and EASI 26.2 vs 26.0 in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. Sleep NRS significantly improved in dupilumab-treated patients at W12 vs. placebo (least squares mean difference [LSMD] -15.1%; P <.001). Peak pruritus NRS (LSMD-28.6%, P <.001), SCORAD (LSM -14.4, P <.001), SCORAD sleep VAS (LSMD-2.3, P <.001), and PROMIS-T Score (LSMD -3.6, P =.001), also improved significantly with dupilumab vs. placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) occurred in 52.8% in the dupilumab group vs. 62.3% with placebo. Four TEAEs (dupilumab: 3 [2.4%]; placebo: 1 [1.6]%) resulted in study discontinuation.

Efficacy and safety of upadacitinib vs dupilumab treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in four body regions -Analysis from the Heads Up Study,,"Objectives: In Heads Up, upadacitinib (UPA) achieved superiority to dupilumab (DUPI) for primary endpoint (proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week [Wk] 16, 71.0% [UPA] vs. 61.1% [DUPI], p < 0.001) and all ranked secondary endpoints in adults with moderate to severe AD. We assessed efficacy of UPA vs DUPI on skin clearance in four body regions. Method(s): Heads Up was a 24-Wk head-to-head phase 3b study comparing safety and efficacy of UPA to DUPI in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Patients were randomized 1:1 to UPA 30 mg orally once daily or DUPI 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every 2 Wks (after initial loading dose). Efficacy was achievement of 75% reduction in EASI for four body regions: Head and Neck, Trunk, Upper Limbs and Lower Limbs, through Wk16. Primary end-points were based on NRI-C (Non-Responder Imputation incorporating Multiple Imputation to handle missing data due to COVID-19). Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in all patients receiving >=1 dose of study drug. Result(s): In total, 692 patients were randomized to UPA (N = 348) or DUPI (N = 344). Greater proportions of patients receiving UPA vs DUPI achieved EASI75 for each body region from Wk1 to Wk16: head and neck (24.8% vs 10.6%, p < 0.001, Wk1) and (64.8% vs 52.5%, p < 0.01, Wk16); trunk (23.9% vs 10.9%, p < 0.001, Wk1) and (70.0% vs 60.5%, p < 0.01, Wk16); upper limb (17.3% vs 7.8%, p < 0.001, Wk1) and (70.4% vs 58.7%, p < 0.01, Wk16); and lower limb (18.5% vs 8.1%, p < 0.001, Wk1) and (72.4% vs 61.2%, p < 0.01, Wk16). Safety was consistent with Ph2b/Ph3 studies with no new safety signals observed. Most common AE reported with UPA was acne (15.8%) and with DUPI, conjunctivitis (9.4%).

Rapidity of efficacy response with abrocitinib versus placebo and dupilumab in the head-neck region of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the phase III JADE COMPARE study,,"To patients, facial atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most visible and burdensome manifestations of AD. To address the need for rapid, thorough improvement of facial AD, we investigated the rapidity of efficacy response with abrocitinib vs. placebo dupilumab in the head-and-neck region of adults with moderate-to-severe AD in a post-hoc analysis of the randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase III JADE COMPARE study (NCT03720470). Adults with moderate-tosevere AD received oral abrocitinib 200 mg or abrocitinib 100 mg once daily, subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks after a 600-mg loading dose, or placebo, with background topical therapy for 16 weeks. Least squares mean (LSM) percentage change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) subscore at week 2 was assessed. In the abrocitinib 200 mg, abrocitinib 100 mg, dupilumab and placebo groups, 226, 238, 242 and 131 patients, respectively, were treated. At baseline, mean (SD) EASI subscores for the head-and-neck region were similar: 2 9 (1 6); 2 8 (1,7); 2 9 (1 6); and 3 0 (1 6), respectively. At week 2, abrocitinib 200 mg and abrocitinib 100 mg were associated with a significantly greater percentage improvement in EASI score than placebo and a numerically greater percentage improvement than dupilumab, with a LSM percentage change from baseline in the head-and-neck region total score of -52 5 [95% confidence interval (CI) -61 4 to -43 6] for abrocitinib 200 mg, -47 8 (95% CI -56 6 to -39 0) for abrocitinib 100 mg, -39 9 (95% CI -48 6 to -31 2) for dupilumab and -0 1 (95% CI -11 8 to -11 5) for placebo. Abrocitinib appears to improve AD in the head-and-neck region faster and more efficaciously than placebo and faster than dupilumab at week 2.

519 Rapid reduction in S. aureus & cytotoxins in dupilumab treated atopic dermatitis subjects,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) severity correlates with S. aureus (SA) colonization and barrier dysfunction. To address the importance of IL-4&-13 on these parameters, the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network designed a 6wk, RDBPC trial (Dupilumab[DPL]:placebo/2:1) with sampling (at 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 & 42 days [d]) to quantify SA, barrier and severity (EASI, NRS, IGA & SCORAD). Seventy-two moderate-severe adult AD subjects were randomized. There was a >7-fold reduction in SA (qPCR) on lesional (L) skin in DPL vs placebo group (1o endpoint [28d];P<0.001). SA abundance (qPCR) on L skin was reduced by 3d (P=0.019) and qPCR & culture quantification were more robustly reduced at 14-42d (P<=0.004). SA reductions (qPCR) in nonlesional (NL) skin were seen >=7d (P<=0.033), but were greater at later timepoints (>=21d;P<=0.025). Shannon diversity increased as early as 14d (L skin) (P<0.001) in DPL group. SA cytotoxins (bioassay) at L sites were reduced by 7d (P=0.04) and more so at later timepoints (>=14d;P<0.001) and reduced at NL sites (>=21d;P<=0.01). TEWL was significantly reduced at 3 & 42d (P<=0.02) and trended downward at 28d (P=0.07) in L skin. DPL treatment was associated with a rapid reduction on L skin of SA abundance, SA derived cytotoxins and greater microbial diversity which preceded significant improvements in all AD severity measures.

DUPILUMAB MONOTHERAPY PROVIDES 1-YEAR SUSTAINED RESPONSE AND REDUCES NEED FOR CONCOMITANT TOPICAL STEROIDS IN ADULTS WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE ATOPIC DERMATITIS OPTIMALLY RESPONDING AT WEEK 16,,"Purpose: To report the use of topical corticosteroids (TCS) over 52 weeks in patients treated with dupilumab who enrolled in the SOLO-CONTINUE study (NCT02395133). Method(s): Adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who had previously participated in SOLO1/2 (NCT02277743/ NCT02277769) and had achieved a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index and/or an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0/1 at Week 16 were enrolled into SOLO-CONTINUE. At SOLO-CONTINUE baseline (Week 16 of SOLO1/2), optimally responding patients were randomized to either continue dupilumab 300mg every 2 weeks (q2w) monotherapy (n=80) or switch from dupilumab to placebo (n=82) for an additional 36 weeks. Any potency TCS use was considered rescue treatment, and patient considered non-responder. Result(s): At Week 52, only 10% of patients treated with dupilumab monotherapy required TCS rescue treatment compared with 33% of patients switching to placebo at Week 16 (P=0.0013). Patients applying TCS while using dupilumab had a mean (SD) use of 0.7 (2.1) days/week, 3 times less than placebo patients who used TCS (2.1 [3.2]). In the small percentage of patients treated with dupilumab who used TCS, most used low-to-moderate potency steroids. Dupilumab was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Conclusion(s): Most patients (90%) who achieved optimal response with 16 weeks of dupilumab q2w remained TCS-free over 36 additional weeks of dupilumab monotherapy treatment.",Agner T.; Worm M.; Simpson E.; Thaci D.; Praestgaard A.; Wortzman-Show G.; Rossi A.,,1651-2057,/10.2340/actadv.v102.2564,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.2340%2factadv.v102.2564,
LEBRIKIZUMAB IMPROVES CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES IN MODERATE-TO-SEVERE ATOPIC DERMATITIS: PHASE 2B STUDY RESULTS,,"Purpose: To assess the efficacy/safety of lebrikizumab and its impact on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in a Phase 2b study (NCT03443024). Method(s): Adult patients (Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI]>=16, Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]>=3, Body Surface Area [BSA]>=10%, AD for >=1 year) were randomized 3:3:3:2 (lebrikizumab 125mg every 4 weeks [Q4W; 250mg loading dose (LD)], lebrikizumab 250mg Q4W [500mg LD], lebrikizumab 250mg Q2W [500mg LD at Baseline/W2] or placebo [PBO]) for 16W. Primary endpoint: EASI percent change from Baseline (%cfB). PRO: pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS; %cfB, >=4-point improvement), sleep-loss NRS (%cfB), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM; cfB), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; cfB), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; cfB). Result(s): At W16, a significant and dose-dependent improvement in mean EASI %cfB in lebrikizumab-groups (125mg Q4W [-62.3%], 250mg Q4W [-69.2%], 250mg Q2W [72.1%] vs PBO [41.1%]) was observed. A greater proportion of lebrikizumab vs PBO patients achieved EASI50/75/90 and IGA 0/1. Improvements in pruritus %cfB in lebrikizumab-groups vs PBO (36.9[p<0.01]/4 8.6[p<0.001]/61.8[p<0.0001] vs. 6.8) were also reported. Lebrikizumab showed greater improvements in POEM/DLQI/HADS and Sleep-loss reduction vs PBO.

LEBRIKIZUMAB IMPROVES ATOPIC DERMATITS SIGNS IN HEAD-AND-NECK AREA,,"Purpose: Post-hoc analysis to evaluate the lebrikizumab efficacy in atopic dermatitis (AD) on the head-and-neck (H&N) area. Method(s): Adults with moderate-to-severe AD (Eczema Area Severity Index [EASI]>=16, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)>=3, >=10% Body Surface Area affected, AD for >=1 year) were randomised (3:3:3:2) to lebrikizumab 125mg every 4 weeks (Q4W; 250mg loading dose [LD]), 250mg Q4W (500mg LD), 250mg Q2W (500mg LD at Baseline/week2), or placebo Q2W for 16W. This post-hoc analysis focuses on 250mg lebrikizumab Q2W (dose which has progressed to phase 3) and placebo. Lastobservation- carried-forward (LOCF) was used for imputing missing data. An ANCOVA model was performed. Result(s): 85.7% of patients had H&N involvement, 88% in 250mg lebrikizumab Q2W and 88% in placebo. Mean(SD) H&N EASI %CFB at Week 16 was -65.6(40.4) in 250mg Q2W vs -35.2(42.7) in placebo.

Dupilumab monotherapy for 1 year provides sustained improvement in Dermatology Life Quality Index in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis optimally responding at week 16,,"The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [range 0 (no effect) to 30 (extremely large effect)] is a 10-item questionnaire assessing the impact of skin disease on patient quality of life (QoL) in areas including symptoms and feelings, hindrance of daily tasks, impact on work/school and leisure activities, effect on personal relationships, and impact of treatment. Here, we evaluate the effect of dupilumab monotherapy for up to 1 year (as measured by DLQI) on patients who achieved a 75% reduction from baseline on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and/or an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0-1 after 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in the 16-week monotherapy LIBERTY AD SOLO 1/2 trials (NCT02277743/NCT02277769) and achieved EASI 75 and/or IGA score of 0-1 at week 16 were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled maintenance phase III study (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE, NCT02395133). We analysed data from 80 patients who were treated with the approved dupilumab dose regimen [300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w)] in SOLO 1/2 and continued q2w monotherapy for an additional 36 weeks (dupilumab-52W treatment group) vs. 83 patients who switched from dupilumab in SOLO 1/2 to placebo (placebo-switch treatment group). Mean DLQI total scores at parent study baseline in both groups were consistent with a very large effect on QoL (14 2 and 13 6 for dupilumab-52W and placebo-switch, respectively). After 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment least squares (LS) mean total DLQI scores in both groups were below 5, corresponding to small effect on QoL (3 3 and 3 5 for dupilumab-52W and placebo-switch, respectively). At week 52, patients who received continuous dupilumab monotherapy maintained a total DLQI score corresponding to a small effect on quality of life (3 2), whereas those who transitioned to placebo at week 16 reported slightly increased DLQI scores indicating a moderate effect (6 7). The percentage of patients who reported no effect of AD on their QoL (total DLQI score 0-1) was 0/1 2 at baseline and 38 8/44 6 at week 16 (for dupilumab-52W/placebo-switch). This percentage was similar at week 52 in the dupilumab 52W treatment group (46 3%) but decreased in the patients who switched to placebo (26 5%). Dupilumab was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Dupilumab provided sustained improvements in QoL over 1 year as assessed by DLQI in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who achieved optimal treatment response after 16 weeks.

Dupilumab monotherapy provides long-term improvement in all Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure items in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"The Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) (range 0 -28, higher score indicates more severe disease) assesses the frequency of seven symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD), i.e. itching, sleep loss, bleeding, weeping, cracking, flaking, and dryness. Here, we report the effect of dupilumab monotherapy for 1 year on symptoms assessed by POEM in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who had earlier achieved a clear or almost clear skin score (0/1) on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and/or a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at week 16 of dupilumab treatment. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in the 16-week LIBERTY AD SOLO 1/2 dupilumab monotherapy trials (NCT02277743/ NCT02277769) and achieved EASI 75 and/or an IGA score of 0/1 at week 16 were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, maintenance phase III study (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE, NCT02395133). We analysed data from 80 patients treated with the approved dupilumab dose regimen [300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w)] in SOLO 1/2 who continued monotherapy q2w for an additional 36 weeks (total 52 weeks) vs. 83 patients who switched from dupilumab in SOLO 1/2 to placebo in SOLO-CONTINUE. Mean total POEM scores at baseline and week 16 of SOLO 1/2 were similar in patients who continued on dupilumab q2w (dupilumab-52W) or switched to placebo (placebo-switch) in SOLO-CONTINUE. At baseline, the score reflected severe disease (19 6/28 and 19 8/28 for dupilumab-52W and placebo-switch patients, respectively). After 16 weeks of monotherapy treatment with dupilumab, least squares (LS) mean POEM scores were below 7 (6 0 and 6 1 for dupilumab-52W and placebo-switch patients, respectively), corresponding to mild disease severity. LS mean change between baseline and week 16 in SOLO1/2 was similar for the patients who continued on dupilumab and for the patients who switched to placebo in SOLO-CONTINUE (-13 6 and - 13 5, respectively). At week 52, patients who had received continuous dupilumab treatment for 52 weeks maintained an LS mean change from baseline of -13 9 (LS mean POEM score 5 7, mild) vs. an LS mean change of -6 6 in the group that switched to placebo (LS mean POEM score 13 0, moderate), indicating sustained improvement with dupilumab monotherapy up to 1 year. The proportion of patients reporting 'no days' or '1-2 days' of itching per week were 2 5%/1 2% at baseline, 48 8%/57 8% at week 16, and 51 3%/22 9% at week 52 in the dupilumab-52W/placeboswitch groups.

Sleep is significantly improved by dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results of the DUPISTAD study,,"Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) often experience sleep disturbance, primarily owing to night-time itching/scratching, which leads to insomnia, daytime fatigue, drowsiness, reduced productivity and impaired quality of life. DUPISTAD was a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study (NCT04033367) designed to evaluate the impact of dupilumab treatment on sleep in patients with AD. Adults aged >= 18 years, with moderate-to-severe AD [Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) >= 12, with a Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) >= 3 and sleep quality NRS <=5] were randomized 2: 1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for a total of 12 weeks. Both treatment groups were permitted to use concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) as needed. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline to week 12 in sleep quality, assessed on a 0-10 NRS where 0 was 'worst possible sleep' and 10 was 'best possible sleep', which was reversed for the analysis to measure sleep disturbance. In total, 127 patients received dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 61 patients received placebo. Mean baseline Sleep NRS score, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) and EASI scores were well balanced between groups: sleep disturbance NRS 6 7 vs. 7 0 (corresponding to sleep quality NRS of 3 3 vs. 3), SCORAD 64 7 vs. 62 8, and EASI 26 2 vs. 26 0). At week 12, the primary endpoint of Sleep NRS improved significantly in patients treated with dupilumab when compared with those who received placebo (least squares mean difference - 15 1%; P < 0 001). With regard to safety, the incidences (dupilumab vs. placebo) of treatment-emergent adverse events were 55 9% vs. 67 2% and serious adverse events were 1 6% vs. 1 6%.

The use of digital health technology to measure nocturnal scratch and sleep in atopic dermatitis: response to abrocitinib,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is often accompanied by nocturnal scratching disrupted sleep. Scratching can lead to lesion formation, infection and worsening sleep disruptions, thereby perpetuating the AD and reducing the patient's quality of life (QoL). Quantitatively measuring nocturnal scratch and sleep is challenging. Currently, studies utilize patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to evaluate the patient's perceptions of the feeling of itch and the patients' impression of their sleep. While it is valuable to understand the patient's perspective regarding these symptoms, such reports do not objectively or quantitatively measure the actions that occur. Objective and quantitative measurements of sleep quantity and nocturnal scratching can assess the efficacy of an intervention on important aspects of AD in a home environment over time. Using wrist-worn accelerometers as the chosen digital health technology, measures of nocturnal scratch and sleep were added as exploratory and optional endpoints to a phase III randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study to assess efficacy and safety of abrocitinib (PF-04965842; 100 or 200 mg once daily) and dupilumab (per label) in adults on background topical therapy, with moderate-to-severe AD (NCT03720470). In selected countries, the amount and duration of nocturnal scratching and the sleep duration and arousals from the total sleep opportunity were assessed using accelerometry. Participants wore watch-like accelerometry devices on each wrist to continuously monitor nocturnal scratching and sleep quantity for up to 1 week prior to the day-1 visit and 2 weeks following the day-1 visit (through day 14). Owing to the limited number of participants (N = 11 evaluable in endpoint analyses), descriptive analyses were performed. Change from baseline (defined as the average of available measures during day -3 to day -1) were calculated for all postdose measurements. As anticipated, during the 2-week treatment and measurement period, treatment with placebo resulted in variable responses with regard to sleep and nocturnal scratch; whereas treatment with abrocitinib (PF04955842) generally showed an increase in sleep efficiency and decrease in scratch duration and events, even with the limited number of participants. Additional clinical studies will allow for further clinical validation to extend our knowledge about the characteristics of the proposed digital endpoints such as minimal clinically importance difference. Wrist-worn accelerometers and associated digital endpoints could provide quantitative knowledge regarding pharmacotherapies on the action of scratching and sleep quantity in a symptomatic AD population. In addition, these novel digital endpoints will enhance our understanding of AD, and provide future opportunities to refine and improve therapies for other conditions.",Zhang Y.; Di J.; Christakis Y.; Mahadevan N.; Bruno J.; Northcott C.A.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.21028,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.21028,
Rapid and sustained improvement in skin pain with abrocitinib in adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Skin pain is a clinically meaningful yet poorly understood symptom in atopic dermatitis (AD), and is associated with itch, sleep difficulties and quality-of-life impairment. The efficacy and safety of abrocitinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor, has been established in patients with moderate-to-severe AD in phase IIb and phase III clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of abrocitinib on skin pain in patients with moderate-to-severe AD in a post hoc analysis of five studies from the abrocitinib JADE clinical programme. Data were analysed from trials with abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg administered as monotherapy [pooled phase IIb (NCT02780167), and phase III JADE MONO-1 (NCT03349060) and MONO-2 (NCT03575871); patients >= 12 years of age], or in combination with topical therapy [phase III JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470; patients >= 18 years of age) and JADE TEEN (NCT03796676; patients 12-17 years of age)]. Patients received abrocitinib 200 mg or abrocitinib 100 mg orally once daily or placebo. The JADE COMPARE study also included an active-control arm (dupilumab 300 mg administered subcutaneously every other week). Patients rated their skin pain over the past 24 h from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms) using the Pruritus and Symptom Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) instrument. Least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in the skin pain score (PSAAD item 2) was recorded over the duration of the studies. At baseline, mean PSAAD item-2 score was 5 6 (SD 2 5) in patients in the pooled monotherapy trials, 5 6 (SD 2 6) in JADE COMPARE, and 5 0 (SD 2 6) in the JADE TEEN trial. Abrocitinib improved skin pain scores as early as week 1 in a dose-dependent manner across all studies. At week 1, LSM change (95% CI) from baseline in pain score was greater in patients receiving abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg vs. placebo [monotherapy: -1 5 (95% CI -1 7 to -1 4) and - 1 1 (95% CI -1 2 to -0 9) vs. -0 1 (95% CI -0 3-0 2); COMPARE: -1 7 (95% CI -1 9 to -1 5) and - 1 3 (95% CI -1 6 to -1 1) vs. -0 8 (95% CI -1 2 to -0 5)]; TEEN: -1 3 (95% CI -1 6 to -1 0) and - 1 1 (95% CI -1 4 to -0 8) vs. -0 4 (95% CI -0 7 to -0 1)].

"Improvement in patient-reported symptoms and quality of life with abrocitinib vs. dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who received background topical therapy: results of a 26-week, randomized, head-to-head trial",,"Abrocitinib was superior to dupilumab in providing itch relief at week 2 of treatment (primary endpoint) and reducing the area and severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) at weeks 4 and 16 (primary and key secondary endpoint) in adults with moderate- to-severe AD in a head-to-head trial (JADE DARE, NCT04345367). The objective of this study was to summarize patient-reported signs, symptoms, and dermatological healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) in patients from the phase IIIb JADE DARE trial. JADE DARE was a 26-week, multicentre, randomized (1: 1), double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, phase IIIb trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral abrocitinib (200 mg once daily) vs. subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background medicated topical therapy. Least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline in the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), assessed at weeks 12, 16 and 26, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), assessed at weeks 2, 12, 16, 20 and 26, were analysed using a mixed-effects model with repeated measures. Differences between the proportions of patients in each treatment group achieving a POEM score of <3 ('clear/almost clear') and a DLQI score of 0/1 ('no effect on HRQoL') were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method adjusted according to baseline disease severity. P-values were not controlled for multiplicity. Significantly greater LSM changes from baseline score with abrocitinib vs. dupilumab were observed for POEM at weeks 12 and 16 and for DLQI at weeks 2, 12, 16 and 20.

In the group of patients treated with abrocitinib (vs. dupilumab) there were significantly higher proportions of patients who achieved clear/almost clear symptoms (POEM <3) at weeks 12 (31% vs. 17%, P < 0 001), 16 (29% vs. 15%, P < 0 001) and 26 (31% vs. 19%, P = 0 001) and patients with no HRQoL impact (DLQI 0/1) at weeks 2 (23% vs. 6%, P < 0 001), 16 (42% vs. 30%, P = 0 001), 20 (44% vs. 33%, P = 0 004) and 26 (40% vs. 32%, P = 0 032). In patients with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background medicated topical therapy, treatment with abrocitinib 200 mg once daily for up to 26 weeks was associated with greater improvements in patient-reported signs, symptoms and HRQoL than dupilumab treatment.",Thyssen J.P.; Hong H.C.; De Bruin-Weller M.; Aschoff R.; Armstrong A.W.; Chovatiya R.; Vestergaard C.; Rojo R.; Valdez H.; Zhang F.; Bhambri A.; Myers D.E.; Watson K.; Guler E.; Clibborn C.; Di Bonaventura M.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.21028,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.21028,
Long-term treatment with tralokinumab normalizes the molecular gene signature of atopic dermatitis,,"Interleukin (IL)-13 is a key driver of skin inflammation barrier abnormalities in atopic dermatitis (AD). Tralokinumab is a high-affinity, monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes IL-13. Tralokinumab demonstrated efficacy and safety for AD treatment in pivotal phase III trials at week 16, and high levels of 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and Investigator's Global Assessment response of 0/1 were sustained through 2 years of continued treatment. Examination of key biomarkers in skin lesions following 16 weeks of tralokinumab treatment showed shifts in inflammatory mediators and skin barrier markers towards that of uninvolved ('nonlesional') skin. The impact of long-term treatment on the molecular phenotype of AD skin has not been previously assessed. We investigated the long-term impact of IL-13 neutralization on skin biomarkers following 2 years of tralokinumab treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe AD in the phase III ECZTRA 1 trial (NCT03131648) and the long-term extension trial ECZTEND (NCT03587805). Skin biopsies (n = 13) were collected from lesional (baseline, week 16, and week 104) and nonlesional skin (baseline and week 104). Gene expression levels of biomarkers related to inflammation and skin barrier integrity were assessed using RNA sequencing and validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Treatment differences were estimated using linear mixed-effect models with treatment and time as fixed effects and random effects for each patient. Our results showed that 2 years of tralokinumab treatment shifted the transcriptomic profile of lesional skin towards that of nonlesional skin; this shift was larger than that seen at week 16. These shifts included genes related to the T helper (Th)2, Th17 and Th22 pathways, and the epidermal barrier. A strong shift was also observed in atherosclerosis signalling pathway genes. At 2 years, tralokinumab treatment also modified the transcriptomic profile of the nonlesional skin, improving the subclinical disease seen at baseline in normal-appearing skin. These shifts in the cutaneous biomarker profile highlight the role of IL-13 as a key driver of the AD molecular signature, and support the role of targeted biological therapy for long-term AD management.",Guttman-Yassky E.; Pavel A.; Kabashima K.; Staumont-Salle D.; Eyerich K.; Nahm W.; Pauser S.; Correa Da Rosa J.; Roepke M.; Amoudruz P.; Schneider S.; Blauvelt A.; Reich K.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.21028,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.21028,
Onset and depth of response with abrocitinib vs. dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: analysis of the phase IIIb JADE DARE clinical trial,,"Abrocitinib has been shown to be superior to dupilumab in providing itch improvement at week 2 of treatment and reducing the area and severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) at weeks 4 and 16 in adults with moderate-to-severe AD in a head-to-head clinical trial [JADE DARE (NCT04345367)]. The objective of this study was to assess the onset and depth of response with abrocitinib vs. dupilumab in adults with moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis in JADE DARE. JADE DARE was a 26-week, multicentre, randomized (1: 1), double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, phase IIIb trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral abrocitinib (200 mg once daily) vs. subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background medicated topical therapy. Differences in the proportions of patients achieving a Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PPNRS) >= 4-point improvement (PP-NRS4), PP-NRS score of < 2, >= 90% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 90) plus a PP-NRS score of < 2, 100% improvement in the EASI (EASI 100), and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method adjusted by baseline IGA score at various time points. P-values were not controlled for multiplicity except for the PP-NRS4 comparisons made on days 2-15. The study enrolled 727 patients (abrocitinib, n = 362; dupilumab, n = 365). At baseline, mean +/- SD EASI score was 28 1 +/- 11 7, PP-NRS score was 7 4 +/- 1 6, and 60%/40% of patients had moderate/severe AD per IGA. A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with abrocitinib achieved PP-NRS < 2, EASI 90 plus PP-NRS < 2, EASI 100 and IGA 0 at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 26 (exceptions being the EASI 100 and IGA 0 at week 2). The proportions of PP-NRS4 responders were significantly higher in the abrocitinib group than in the dupilumab group from days 2 (11% vs. 4%, P = 0 0006) to 15 (49% vs. 26%, P < 0 001) and at weeks 4 (58% vs. 41%, P < 0 001) and 8 (66% vs. 53%, P = 0 0004). Median time to PP-NRS4 response was 11 days in the abrocitinib group and 25 days in the dupilumab group (P < 0 001). In patients with moderate-to-severe AD receiving background medicated topical therapy, those treated with abrocitinib achieved an earlier onset of clinically meaningful itch improvement compared with those treated with dupilumab, with differences observed 1 day after the first dose.

Efficacy and safety of switching from dupilumab to upadacitinib in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results from an open-label extension trial,,"Upadacitinib (UPA) is a selective oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 than JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2. Phase II and III studies demonstrated that once-daily UPA 15 mg or 30 mg is effective and well tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In the phase IIIb Heads Up clinical trial, UPA 30 mg demonstrated superior efficacy vs. dupilumab (DUPI) for the primary and all secondary endpoints in adults with moderate- to-severe AD. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of UPA using interim data from the open-label extension (OLE) study that followed Heads Up (M19-850, NCT04195698). The efficacy and safety of open-label UPA 30 mg was evaluated in patients who were initially randomized to either UPA 30 mg orally once daily or DUPI 300 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks (after initial loading dose), completed the 24- week Heads Up study, and were candidates for long-term UPA therapy. Regardless of response to treatment in Heads Up, all patients received open-label UPA 30 mg orally once daily upon entry to the OLE; there was no washout period, with the last dose of DUPI administered at week 22 in Heads Up. Efficacy was assessed as proportions of patients achieving 75%, 90% or 100% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75/90/100) in addition to improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale >= 4 (WP-NRS Improvement >= 4) upon entry and after 16 weeks into M19-850, using an observed cases (OC) analysis. Safety was assessed using treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) for all patients receiving at least one dose of study drug. A total of 245 patients initially randomized to DUPI and 239 patients initially randomized to UPA who completed Heads Up were subsequently enrolled in the OLE and treated with open-label UPA 30 mg. At the end of Heads Up (week 24), 85 7%, 66 4%, 16 0% and 63 4% of patients treated with DUPI achieved EASI 75, EASI 90, EASI 100 and WP-NRS Improvement >= 4, respectively. After 16 weeks of UPA treatment (week 40), 96 6% achieved EASI 75, 87 7% achieved EASI 90, 42 4% achieved EASI 100, and 78 7% achieved WP-NRS Improvement >= 4. Among patients who did not achieve EASI 75 on DUPI at week 24 in Heads Up, 87 5% achieved EASI 75, 68 8% achieved EASI 90, and 21 9% achieved EASI 100 after 16 weeks on UPA. Similarly, among patients who did not achieve WP-NRS Improvement >= 4 at week 24 with DUPI, 57 7% achieved WP-NRS Improvement >= 4 after 16 weeks on UPA. Among patients initially randomized to UPA who continued on open-label UPA, the proportions of patients achieving EASI 75, EASI 90, EASI 100 and WP-NRS Improvement >= 4 at the end of Heads Up were maintained through week 16 of the OLE. The safety profile of UPA 30 mg remained unchanged with continued treatment. Exposure-adjusted rates of serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs of special interest reported with UPA were generally lower or similar compared with those observed in the parent study; no new safety risks were observed. At week 40, both continued use of UPA and switching from DUPI to UPA at week 24 were well tolerated and resulted in improved efficacy with higher rates of skin clearance and itch improvement when compared with week-24 response rates.",Blauvelt A.; Ladizinski B.; Prajapati V.H.; Laquer V.; Fischer A.; Eisman S.; Wu T.; Vigna N.; Teixeira H.D.; Liu J.; Eyerich K.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.21028,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.21028,
"Dupilumab monotherapy provides 1-year sustained response in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis optimally responding at week 16, with no need for concomitant topical steroids",,"The efficacy and safety of dupilumab with topical corticosteroids (TCS) in the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) over 1 year have been assessed in the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study LIBERTY AD CHRONOS (NCT02260986). In the SOLO-CONTINUE study (monotherapy, randomized, placebo-controlled; NCT02395133), the maintenance of efficacy and safety of dupilumab was evaluated for an additional 36 weeks in patients who had achieved either an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear skin) and/ or a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) at week 16 of SOLO 1 or SOLO 2. Here we report the percentage of patients treated over an additional 36 weeks with dupilumab monotherapy who did not require TCS (rescue treatment). Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in SOLO 1/2 (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) and had achieved EASI 75 and/or an IGA score of 0/1 at week 16 were enrolled in this randomized, long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE, NCT02395133). In SOLOCONTINUE, TCS use of any potency was considered rescue treatment; patients who received rescue treatment were considered treatment failures. Here we show data for patients treated in SOLO-CONTINUE who continued 300 mg dupilumab monotherapy every 2 weeks (q2w) or who were randomized to placebo for an additional 36 weeks. At SOLOCONTINUE baseline (month 4), patients were randomized to continue dupilumab 300 mg q2w (n = 80) monotherapy or switched from dupilumab treatment to placebo (n = 82). Use of any potency of topical steroid was considered rescue treatment and failure to respond. At month 12, only 10% of patients who received dupilumab monotherapy required TCS rescue compared with 33% of patients who switched to placebo at week 16 (P = 0 001). In the small percentage of patients treated with dupilumab who used TCS, most used low-to-moderate potency steroids. Dupilumab was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile.

Dupilumab provides long-term efficacy over 2 5 years in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Here, we explore the long-term efficacy of dupilumab in patients who optimally responded at week 16 of the doubleblind placebo-controlled studies SOLO 1 and 2 and subsequently enrolled in SOLO-CONTINUE for 36 weeks of maintenance with dupilumab monotherapy [weekly (qw)/every 2 weeks (q2w)] or placebo (PBO), followed by 76 weeks of dupilumab qw in an open-label extension (OLE) study. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in SOLO 1/2 (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) and had achieved a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and/or an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 at week 16 were enrolled in SOLO-CONTINUE (NCT02395133) for an additional 36 week, followed by 76 weeks in the OLE (NCT01949311). Here we analyse patients who maintained response, defined as proportion of patients achieving IGA <=2. At SOLO-CONTINUE baseline (week 16 of parent study), patients on 300 mg dupilumab q2w or qw achieving IGA 0/1 and/or EASI 75 were rerandomized to continuing q2w, qw or PBO of which 73 patients (q2w), 81 patients (qw) and 75 patients (PBO) were subsequently treated with dupilumab 300 mg qw for an additional 76 weeks. Patients maintained on dupilumab monotherapy over an additional 36 weeks maintained response as measured by the proportion of patients achieving IGA <=2, with similar results for patients treated qw or q2w (88 9%/86 3% vs. 44 0% for patients moving to PBO; P < 0 001) or EASI 75 (86 4%/87 7% vs. 48 0%; P < 0 001) by week 52. When patients transitioned to OLE, both patients who continued to receive dupilumab 300 mg qw and those transitioning from q2w to qw sustained their responses; patients on PBO transitioning to dupilumab 300 mg qw showed rapid improvement within the first month, which was maintained through to week 128, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving IGA <=2 (93 3%/95 1%/97 3%) or EASI 75 (92 0%/100%/97 3%). Dupilumab was generally well tolerated, with safety consistent with that observed in SOLO 1/2.

Patient wellbeing and perception of treatment effect with long-term dupilumab monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) are affected by a high burden of disease, and the patient's subjective assessment of response is an important factor in the longterm management of this chronic condition. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, targets both interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, which are key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in AD. We investigated patient wellbeing and perception of the treatment effect of dupilumab monotherapy over 1 year in patients optimally responding at week 16 in SOLO 1/2. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in SOLO 1/2 (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) and had achieved a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and/or an Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0/1 at week 16 were enrolled in this randomized, long-term, double-blind, placebo- controlled phase III study (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE, NCT02395133). Here we present data for patients treated in SOLO-CONTINUE with 300-mg dupilumab monotherapy every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for an additional 36 weeks. Patients were asked 'Considering all the ways in which your eczema affects you, indicate how well you are doing' to assess their perception of wellbeing and 'How would you rate the way your eczema responded to the study medication?' to assess their perception of treatment effect. Possible responses included poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. At SOLO-CONTINUE baseline (week 16 of parent study), patients on dupilumab q2w or once weekly who met response criteria were rerandomized to either continuation of dupilumab q2w (n = 80) or placebo (n = 83). After 52 weeks on monotherapy with dupilumab q2w, 71% of patients responded 'very good' or 'excellent' in their assessment of wellbeing and 78% considered the treatment effect 'very good' or 'excellent' compared with 21% and 27% of patients treated with dupilumab for 16 weeks followed by placebo for 36 weeks. The differences between dupilumab q2w and placebo at week 52 were statistically significant (P < 0 001). Dupilumab was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Most patients who achieved optimal response after 16 weeks of treatment and continued on dupilumab 300 mg q2w monotherapy rated both their wellbeing and perception of treatment effect as 'very good' or 'excellent' over 1 year of treatment; however, this was not observed for patients who switched to placebo after week 16.",Simpson E.L.; Beissert S.; Beck L.A.; Zhang H.; Aamodt K.; Rossi A.B.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.21028,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.21028,
Dupilumab monotherapy provides long-term control and prevents flares in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis optimally responding at week 16,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease requiring long-term management to achieve disease control. The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab, a targeted biological therapy approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD, have been reported in combination with topical corticosteroids (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, NCT02260986). Dupilumab every 2 weeks (q2w) in combination with TCS has been shown to prevent disease exacerbations (flares) in more than 80% of patients treated in CHRONOS. Here we assess the incidence of flares in patients over 36 weeks of maintenance treatment with dupilumab q2w monotherapy after an optimal response at week 16 of dupilumab monotherapy. Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in SOLO 1/2 (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) and had achieved a 75% reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75) and/or an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1 at week 16 were enrolled in this randomized, long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE, NCT02395133).

"Interim analysis results from a proof-ofconcept study for ASLAN004 in adult moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study",,"Background: ASLAN004 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-13Ra1 with high affinity and inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling via the Type 2 cytokine receptor, an important target in atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective(s): To evaluate the emerging safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ASLAN004 in a multipleascending dose escalation phase in patients with moderate to severe AD. Method(s): Twenty-five adult patients with moderate to severe AD were recruited from the US, Australia and Singapore and randomized 3:1 in three cohorts to receive once weekly 200, 400 or 600mg of subcutaneous ASLAN004 or matching placebo over eight weeks, with a 12-week recovery period. An interim data readout was conducted after Cohorts 1-3 completed eight weeks of treatment to evaluate various clinical endpoints in a limited number of patients before conducting an expansion cohort (Cohort 4, results reported elsewhere). Endpoints in the interim analysis include change from baseline in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) score at week 8 and safety assessments including local tolerability and incidence of adverse events (AEs). [NCT04090229] Results: Three of 25 patients randomized into Cohorts 1-3 discontinued due to restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 18 of the remaining 22 patients in the planned interim data readout completed at least 29 days of dosing and assessment and were evaluable for efficacy. The mean +/- SD (n=18) baseline scores were 32.5+/-11.8 for EASI and 44% had severe Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scores.

Effect of Dupilumab on the Host-Microbe Interface in Atopic Dermatitis,,"Rationale: Dupilumab (DPL) inhibits IL-4 and -13 biological actions. Whether DPL treatment improves skin microbial and barrier abnormalities in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients is unknown. Method(s): The Atopic Dermatitis Research Network designed a multi-center, RDBPC trial with skin sampling (0,3,7,14,21,28 & 42days [d]) to quantify microbial changes. Primary endpoint was Staphylococcus aureus(SA) abundance (femA qPCR) on lesional skin at 28d. Secondary endpoints were: 1) Lesional SA abundance at remaining timepoints and nonlesional skin at all timepoints, 2) skin barrier (Transepidermal Water Loss [TEWL]) and 3) EASI, IGA, SCORAD & NRS. Result(s): Moderate-severe adult AD subjects (N=72) were randomized 2:1 to DPL vs placebo. Lesional SA qPCR abundance was reduced in DPL-treated subjects by 3d (P=0.019), but more robustly at 14,21,28,42d (P<=0.004), which was replicated by culture quantification with reductions at 7,14,21,28,42d (P<=0.006). Reductions in SA were seen in nonlesional skin at 7d and 28d (P<=0.03). Lesional TEWL was significantly reduced in DPL-treated subjects at 3 and 42d (P<=0.03) and trended downward at 28d (P=0.07). Conclusion(s): The randomized populations were well matched. DPL dramatically reduced SA abundance on lesional skin, which was observed very early (3d), but was most significant >=14d. The reductions observed in nonlesional skin were less robust. This is the first demonstration that DPL improves skin barrier function which was observed by 28d, reaching significance at 42d. AD severity metrics (EASI, SCORAD, NRS, IGA) and safety measures were consistent with pivotal trials. Next steps will address whether reductions in SA or improvements in skin barrier are key determinants of disease improvement.Copyright © 2021",Beck L.; Boguniewicz M.; Hata T.; Fuxench Z.; Simpson E.; De Benedetto A.; Ko J.; Ong P.; Yoshida T.; Gallo R.; Brar K.; Schlievert P.; Villareal M.; Lussier S.; David G.; Rudman-Spergel A.; Leung D.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.12.503,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed23&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2021.12.503,
Dupilumab in Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis and Prior Use of Systemic Non-Steroidal Immunosuppressants: Analysis of Four Phase 3 Trials,,"Introduction: Dupilumab is approved as first-line systemic treatment for adults/adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in Europe and elsewhere owing to its favourable benefit-risk profile. However, systemic non-steroidal immunosuppressants (NSISS) are often used as first-line therapy in clinical practice. Impact of prior therapy with NSISS on dupilumab's treatment effect vs. control has not been described previously. This study assessed dupilumab's efficacy vs. control in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, comparing treatment effect in patients with/without prior systemic NSISS therapy, in four phase 3 trials. Method(s): This post hoc analysis included 1553 patients randomized to placebo or dupilumab (300 mg q2w) as monotherapy for 16 weeks, or with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) for 16/52 weeks, from four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials. Patients were stratified by prior use of systemic NSISS and dupilumab-treated patients were analysed against control groups (treated with placebo or placebo + TCS). Result(s): Dupilumab-treated patients, regardless of prior treatment with NSISS, achieved a significantly higher percentage reduction from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Dermatology life Quality Index (DLQI), and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) vs. control; significantly more achieved EASI score <= 7, Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale <= 4, POEM <= 7, and DLQI <= 5 by week 4. These rapid, significant improvements were seen with or without concomitant TCS and sustained through end-of-treatment. Conclusion(s): Dupilumab treatment (monotherapy or + TCS) provides rapid, significant, sustained improvements in signs, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe AD compared with control, regardless of prior systemic NSISS use.

PATIENT PERCEPTION OF TREATMENT WITH LONG-TERM DUPILUMAB MONOTHERAPY IN ADULTS WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE ATOPIC DERMATITIS,,"Introduction: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, targets both interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD). We investigated patient perception of well-being and treatment effect of dupilumab monotherapy over 1 year in patients with moderate-to-severe AD optimally responding at Week 16 in SOLO 1/2. Method(s): Adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in SOLO 1/2 (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769) and achieved optimal response (EASI-75 or IGA 0/1) at Week 16 were enrolled in this phase 3 study (SOLO-CONTINUE, NCT02395133). In this study, patients optimally responding to the parent trial at Week 16 were re-randomized to 300mg dupilumab monotherapy every 1/2/4/8 weeks (qw/q2w/q4w/q8w) or placebo for an additional 36 weeks. Patients were asked to assess both their perception of well-being and perception of treatment effect. Possible responses included: poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent. Result(s): At Week 16, 80/83 patients were treated with 300mg dupilumab q2w/placebo. After 52 weeks on dupilumab q2w monotherapy, significantly more patients responded with ""good"", ""very good"" or ""excellent"" in their assessment of well-being (86%) and treatment effect (93%) compared with patients re-randomized to placebo at Week 16 for 36 weeks (48% and 49%; P<0.0001). Dupilumab had an acceptable safety profile. Conclusion(s): Most patients achieving optimal response after 16 weeks of treatment and maintained on dupilumab 300mg q2w monotherapy rated both their well-being and perception of treatment effect as good, very good or excellent over 1 year of treatment.Copyright © 2021",Simpson E.; Lacour J.; Beck L.; Zhang H.; Aamodt K.; ROSSI A.,,1081-1206,/10.1016/j.anai.2021.08.167,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.anai.2021.08.167,
"The effect of tezepelumab in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and comorbid atopic dermatitis: Results from the NAVIGATOR phase 3 study",,"Background: Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial-derived cytokine. The NAVIGATOR phase 3 study (NCT03347279) investigated the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma. This prespecified, exploratory analysis evaluated the effect of tezepelumab in patients from NAVIGATOR who had comorbid atopic dermatitis (AD) at baseline. Method(s): NAVIGATOR was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients (12-80 years old) who were receiving medium-or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids, were randomized 1:1 to receive tezepelumab 210 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks was assessed in patients with and without reported comorbid AD at baseline. Result(s): Of 1061 randomized patients, 1059 received study treatment (tezepelumab 210 mg, n = 528; placebo, n = 531). At baseline, 127 of these patients (~12%) had comorbid AD and 932 did not have comorbid AD. Patients with comorbid AD had higher blood eosinophil counts (median: 310 vs 240 cells/muL) and serum total immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels (median: 371.0 vs 177.2 IU/mL) at baseline, and were more likely to have a positive fluorescence enzyme immunoassay test for specific IgE against a perennial aeroallergen than those without comorbid AD (78% vs 62%). In the placebo group, the AAER was similar in patients with and without comorbid AD. Tezepelumab reduced the AAER over 52 weeks versus placebo by 58% (95% confidence interval: 27-75) and 56% (95% confidence interval: 46-64) in patients with and without comorbid AD, respectively (Figure). Conclusion(s): Tezepelumab reduced exacerbations versus placebo in adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma with and without comorbid AD at baseline, further supporting its potential benefits in a broad population of patients.

"Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of eosinophilic esophagitis patients enrolled in part a of the 3-part, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 treet study",,"Background: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic type 2 inflammatory disease of the esophagus, which has a male predominance and is most commonly diagnosed in young adults. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases including EoE. Part A of the 3-part, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase 3 LIBERTY EoE TREET study (NCT03633617) evaluated the efficacy and safety of weekly (qw) dupilumab 300 mg vs placebo in adolescent and adult EoE patients for 24 weeks. Co-primary endpoints - the proportion of patients achieving peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count <= 6 eosinophils/high power field (eos/hpf) and change from baseline in Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) score at Week 24 - were achieved, and dupilumab was well tolerated. This analysis presents detailed baseline demographics of the patients in Part A of the phase 3 EoE TREET study. Method(s): The study enrolled 81 patients aged >= 12 years with a documented diagnosis of EoE, as evidenced by a peak eosinophil count of >= 15 eos/hpf in >= 2 of the 3 regions of the esophagus; unresponsive to 8-week treatment with high-dose proton-pump inhibitors; no other causes of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease; a history of >= 2 episodes of dysphagia per week over 4 weeks; >= 4 episodes of dysphagia in the 2 weeks prior to baseline, >= 2 of which required medical attention or liquids, or involved coughing, gagging, or vomiting; and a DSQ score >= 10. All patients were eligible to continue into Part C, a 28-week extended treatment period. Result(s): Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics were similar in both treatment groups (Table). The overall study population was predominantly male (60.5%) and Caucasian (96.3%) with a mean body mass index of 26.1 (standard deviation [SD] 6.3). The mean age was 31.5 (SD 14.3) years, and 24.7% of the trial population were adolescents aged 12-18 years. The mean duration of EoE was 5.0 (SD 4.3) years with a mean of 2 prior esophageal dilations (SD 1.3), and 40.7% of the patients were on food-elimination diets at screening. 74.1% of the study population had previously used swallowed topical corticosteroids, and 54.3% were steroid refractory. Overall, 84.0% of patients had a current history of concurrent self-reported mild-to-moderate type 2 inflammatory disease, including allergic rhinitis (59.3%), food allergies (44.4%), other allergies (48.1%, e.g. pollen, animals, dust mites), asthma (30.9%), and atopic dermatitis (18.5%). Mean baseline DSQ score (range 0-84) was 33.6 (SD 12.4); mean baseline EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (range 0-18) was 6.3 (SD 2.8); and mean baseline EoE Histologic Scoring System grade and stage scores (range 0-3) were both 1.3 (SD 0.4).

The era of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis: What do we need to fulfil the promise of a treatment revolution?,,"Many novel systemic agents are emerging, which may have great potential in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Despite this, there are very few data comparing these drugs against conventional systemic agents, which have been used to treat AD for decades. The aim of this study is to indirectly compare systemic AD treatments using effectiveness and safety data from randomised controlled trials. 43 trials, reporting a diverse range of primary endpoints, were included. This comparison suggests that ciclosporin in the short-term and methotrexate and azathioprine in the long-term may perform as well as many of the novel agents. Although dupilumab and JAK inhibitors have superior efficacy compared with ciclosporin (2.5-5 mg/kg/day) in terms of EASI, SCORAD reduction induced by these agents suggests that ciclosporin at 5 mg/kg/day may be as effective at least for short-term control. Nemolizumab and the JAK inhibitors appear to be superior for pruritus, although the pruritus data for conventional agents is limited. Regarding long-term disease control, dupilumab and nemolizumab appear superior but there are no data beyond 64 weeks. Although short-term data suggest novel systemics may be safer than conventional agents, data on long-term safety of both systemics in AD are limited. This study shows how novel and conventional systemic agents compare in AD and highlights important remaining knowledge gaps, including long-term safety and efficacy data, particularly for the novel agents. Although the latest developments in AD treatments are exciting, further work including head-to-head trials with standardised safety reporting and validated outcome measures are needed.",Alexander H.; Flohr C.,,1651-2057,/10.2340/00015555-3793,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.2340%2f00015555-3793,
"Use of topical corticosteroids with tralokinumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Results from the 32-week, phase 3 ecztra 3 trial",,"Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the current mainstay of atopic dermatitis (AD) therapy, but are often insufficient to achieve disease control in moderate-to-severe AD. Tralokinumab, a monoclonal antibody, specifically neutralizes interleukin-13, a key type 2 cytokine involved in AD. This double-blind, 32-week study assessed efficacy, safety, and use of tralokinumab+TCS combination therapy in moderate-to-severe AD. Patients were randomized 2:1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (q2w)+TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% cream) as needed. Primary endpoints were Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 at Week 16. Secondary endpoints included amount of TCS used. After Week 16, tralokinumab-treated patients continued q2w or every 4 weeks+TCS as needed, for another 16 weeks. At Week 16, IGA 0/1 (38.9 vs 26.2%; p = 0.015) and EASI-75 (56.0 vs 35.7%; p < 0.001) were achieved by significantly more tralokinumab- treated patients than placebo. Through Week 16, a smaller proportion of tralokinumab than placebo patients used rescue treatment (2.8 vs 10.2%) and less TCS was used cumulatively by tralokinumab than placebo patients (134.9 vs 193.5 g; DELTA -58.6). At Weeks 15-16, tralokinumab-treated patients used ~50% less TCS compared to placebo (adjusted geometric mean, 3.9 vs 7.9 g; ratio of means, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7; p < 0.001), and 55.3% used no or limited amounts (0-5 g) of TCS, compared to 36.7% for placebo. Tralokinumab 300 mg q2w+TCS was significantly more efficacious in treating moderate-to-severe AD than placebo.

Efficacy and Safety of Tralokinumab Monotherapy in North American Adult Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: A Subanalysis of the ECZTRA 2 Trial,,"Introduction: Two double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational, 52-week (wk), phase 3 trials demonstrated efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2). This subanalysis examined efficacy and safety outcomes in North American patients in the ECZTRA 2 trial. Methods, Results: The ECZTRA 2 trial enrolled 794 patients worldwide. Enrolment was stratified by baseline disease severity and region and included 361 (45%) patients from North America comprised of Canada and the US. Patients were randomized 3:1 to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W or placebo for 16wks. Co-primary efficacy outcomes were Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 at wk16. Adverse events were collected throughout the 52 wk study period. North American patients were 53.7% White, 24.9% Asian, 15.8% Black or African American, and 5.6% other. They had slightly less severe disease than the general study population, with mean baseline body surface area (BSA) affected and EASI score of 43.9% and 28.4, respectively, and 43.2% had severe disease (IGA-4). North American patients had lower prior use of conventional systemic immunosuppressants compared to the general study population. At wk16, IGA-0/1 responses were 25.9% (tralokinumab) vs. 14.3% (placebo; P = 0.021) and EASI-75 responses were 40.4% vs. 15.4% (P < 0.001). Rescue medications were used by 18.1% and 41.8% of patients, respectively. Overall adverse event rate was similar between tralokinumab and placebo over 16wks.

"A phase III double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib versus dupilumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis receiving background topical therapy (JADE DARE)",,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by skin lesions, and is a general burden on patients and society. Treatments for moderate-to-severe AD are lacking and some patients experience insufficient response to available options, such as dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. Abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily, Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor under investigation for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, was well tolerated and produced significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of AD relative to placebo when administered as monotherapy at 200mg or 100mg in two pivotal phase III studies of patients aged >= 12years with moderate-to-severe AD (JADE MONO-1 and JADE MONO-2). Moreover, in the pivotal phase III JADE COMPARE study, abrocitinib 200mg or 100mg, in combination with background topical therapy, significantly improved the signs and symptoms of AD compared with placebo in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD, and abrocitinib 200mg was superior to dupilumab in itch reduction at week 2. A deeper understanding of the effect of abrocitinib on clinical outcomes relative to dupilumab is warranted. JADE DARE, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multicentre study (NCT04345367), was conducted to demonstrate the superiority of abrocitinib 200mg once daily to dupilumab as measured by Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4) response at week 2 and >= 90% improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90) response at week 4. Additionally, this study is intended to demonstrate that abrocitinib 200mg once daily is noninferior to dupilumab and-if noninferior-to demonstrate superiority to dupilumab as measured by EASI-90 response at week 16. Eligible patients are aged >= 18years with a clinical diagnosis of chronic moderate-to-severe AD [defined as Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score >= 3; Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score >= 16; percentage of body surface area (%BSA) affected >= 10; Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS; the PP-NRS is used with permission of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Sanofi) severity score >= 4] for >= 6months, who have a recent history of inadequate response to treatment with medicated topical therapy for AD, or who have required systemic therapies to control their disease. Approximately 600 patients will be enrolled from approximately 220 sites globally for a treatment duration of 26weeks. Patients will be randomlyassigned (1: 1) to receive 200mg oral abrocitinib or 300mg subcutaneous dupilumab. The co-primary endpoints are response based on at least a 4-point improvement in the severity of PP-NRS4 from baseline at week 2 and response based on EASI-90 from baseline at week 4. The key secondary endpoint is EASI-90 response at week 16. Secondary endpoints based on EASI and PP-NRS include EASI-90 at other scheduled time points up to week 26, >= 75% improvement from baseline in the EASI at scheduled time points up to week 26, PP-NRS4 at scheduled time points except week 2 and time from baseline to PP-NRS4. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints are response based on an IGA of clear (0) or almost clear (1), and a reduction from baseline of >= 2 points at scheduled time points up to week 26, percentage change from baseline in %BSA affected at scheduled time points, percentage changes from baseline in the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis at all scheduled time points, and changes from baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Dermatology Life Quality Index; EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension, 5-Level Scale; Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure; Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale; and Skin Pain Numerical Rating Scale at all scheduled time points.

Depth and rapidity of response with abrocitinib and dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in JADE COMPARE,,"Emerging treatments for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) could provide greater and faster improvement in AD signs and symptoms than current therapies. The objective of this post-hoc analysis of JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470) data was to examine the depth and rapidity of response to abrocitinib and dupilumab using stringent endpoints. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned 2: 2: 2: 1 to receive oral abrocitinib 200 or 100mg once daily, subcutaneous dupilumab 300mg every 2weeks after a 600-mg loading dose or placebo with background topical therapy for 16weeks.

We performed an interim analysis of ECZTEND trial data to assess the long-term efficacy of tralokinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD based on Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores. Overall, 1174 patients were included in ECZTEND at data cutoff (April 2020). Outcomes were analysed as observed at week 56 and included all patients enrolled 60weeks prior to data cutoff (n=612). Median time since last treatment dose in parent trials (Wollenberg etal., Silverberg etal.) to first treatment dose in ECZTEND was 36days. Median age was 38years, 57% were male, and median duration of AD was 27years at baseline for all patients. At parent-trial baseline, ECZTEND baseline and week 56, median (interquartile range) EASI scores were 26.9 (19.7-37.3), 4.8 (2.0-12.6) and 1.8 (0.4-5.6), respectively.

We investigated the efficacy of abrocitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were dupilumab nonresponders. In JADE-COMPARE (NCT03720470), adult nonresponders after 16weeks of dupilumab treatment (600mg subcutaneous loading dose, then 300mg every 2weeks with background medicated topical therapy) underwent a 4-week washout period and were then randomly assigned to receive oral abrocitinib 200mg or 100mg once daily (background topical therapy at patient/investigator discretion) in a double-blind, phase III, long-term extension study (JADE-EXTEND; NCT03422822). Dupilumab nonresponse was failure to achieve Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response [clear (0) or almost clear (1) and >= 2-grade improvement from baseline); failure to achieve >= 75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75); or failure to achieve >= 4-point improvement from baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4; the PP-NRS is used with permission of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Sanofi).

"Impact of targeting interleukin-13 on Staphylococcus aureus colonization: Results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with tralokinumab in adult patients with atopic dermatitis",,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease with a high disease burden. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, characterized mainly by increased levels of type 2 cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-13, and skin barrier dysfunction, which collectively lead to microbial dysbiosis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization. This dysbiosis is associated with greater AD severity and correlates with AD flares. Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes IL-13. In the ECZTRA 1 phase III trial (NCT03131648), tralokinumab led to significant improvements in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores compared with placebo. The objective of this exploratory analysis was to characterize the effect of tralokinumab treatment on eliminating S. aureus colonization. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 3: 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300mg or placebo every 2weeks for an initial 16weeks. Changes in skin colonization by S. aureus at week 16 in patients was an exploratory endpoint. Absolute abundance of S. aureus on lesional skin was assessed by rotation of sterile swabs on the skin, followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of extracted DNA. Association of S. aureus colonization with disease severity and select serum or skin biomarkers was assessed. The ratio between treatment groups in relative reduction cutaneous S. aureus from baseline to week 16 was assessed by a t-test of changes in log-transformed values. In total, 802 patients were randomized to tralokinumab (n=603) or placebo (n=199); 50.7% had severe AD (IGA 4; 5-point scale) at baseline; mean EASI score was 32.4. Staphylococcus aureus colonization correlated with disease severity (EASI score) at baseline and week 16. Staphylococcus aureus colonization further correlated significantly with serum levels of biomarkers, including IL-13, IL-22 and human beta defensin-2 at baseline and week 16. Median S. aureus abundance was reduced more from baseline to week 16 in patients receiving tralokinumab (n=555; from 969 to 22 gene copies cm-2) vs. placebo (n=184; from 649 to 238 gene copies cm-2), with a 10-fold greater reduction in tralokinumab-treated patients vs. those who received placebo (ratio = 0.09; P<0.001). Treatment with tralokinumab was associated with significant reduction in S. aureus colonization in lesional skin compared with placebo in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This supports previous studies (Guttman-Yassky E, Silverberg J, Fensholdt J etal. Tralokinumab significantly reduces Staphylococcus aureus colonization in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: results from a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Presented at EADV, Paris, France, 2018; poster P0283) and suggests that reduction of S. aureus colonization by the neutralization of IL-13 contributes to the efficacy of tralokinumab in improving the hallmarks of AD and breaking the cycle of itching, scratching, skin barrier dysfunction and immune-mediated inflammation.",Bieber T.; Beck L.A.; Pink A.; Saeki H.; Eichenfield L.; Werfel T.; Rosholm A.; Roepke M.; Paller A.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.20648,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.20648,
"Neutralizing interleukin-13 increases skin microbial diversity: Results from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tralokinumab in adult patients with atopic dermatitis",,"A healthy skin barrier supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria and virulence factors. In atopic dermatitis (AD), recent studies have pointed to a lack of microbial diversity in both lesional and nonlesional skin. Dysregulation of the skin microflora in AD is believed to be influenced by epidermal barrier disruption and T helper 2-driven inflammation, in which interleukin (IL)-13 plays a major role. Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that has proven efficacious in improving the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe AD by neutralizing IL-13. We investigated the change in microbial diversity in lesional skin of patients with AD treated with tralokinumab in a phase III clinical trial (ECZTRA 1; NCT03131648). Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 3: 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300mg or placebo every 2weeks for 16weeks. Skin swabs collected at baseline and, after 8weeks and 16weeks of treatment, were assessed for microbial diversity by DNA sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA. Treatment with tralokinumab was associated with an increase in skin microbial diversity vs. placebo. The increase in skin microbial diversity observed with tralokinumab treatment supports the notion that neutralization of IL-13 contributes to improving the hallmarks of AD by breaking the cycle of itching, scratching, skin barrier dysfunction and immune-mediated inflammation, thereby shifting the microbial diversity on AD lesional skin towards a commensal flora. It remains to be elucidated whether the lack of microbial diversity in AD is a net result of an epidermal barrier defect or a cause of barrier dysfunction and inflammation.",Bieber T.; Beck L.A.; Pink A.; Saeki H.; Eichenfield L.; Werfel T.; Rosholm A.; Ropke M.; Paller A.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.20648,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.20648,
Long-term safety and disease control with ruxolitinib cream in patients with more severe atopic dermatitis: Pooled results from two phase III studies,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly pruritic inflammatory skin disease. The severity of AD is often stratified using objective [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), body surface area (BSA)] and subjective [e.g. itch numerical rating scale (NRS)] assessment tools. Topical therapies are the standard of care for most patients with AD. For patients with more severe AD, systemic therapies may be considered as monotherapy or in combination with topical therapies. Ruxolitinib cream is a Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 inhibitor in development for the treatment of AD. In two phase III randomized studies of identical design [TRuE-AD1 (NCT03745638) and TRuE-AD2 (NCT03745651)], 1249 patients aged >= 12years with AD for >= 2years with an IGA score of 2 or 3 and 3-20% affected body surface area (BSA) were randomized (2: 2: 1) to twice-daily ruxolitinib 0.75% cream, ruxolitinib 1.5% cream or vehicle cream for an 8-week, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled (VC) period followed by a double-blinded long-term safety (LTS) period up to week 52. Patients initially randomized to ruxolitinib cream remained on their regimen; patients initially on vehicle were re-randomized (1: 1) to either ruxolitinib cream strength. During the VC period, patients were instructed to continue treating lesions, regardless of lesion improvement. During the LTS period, patients were to treat skin areas with active AD only and stop treatment 3days after clearance of lesions. Patients were to restart treatment with ruxolitinib cream at the first sign of recurrence. Here, we evaluated the long-term safety and disease control of ruxolitinib cream in the subpopulation of patients with more severe AD at baseline. The definition of more severe AD was based on the inclusion criteria for clinical trials of systemic therapies (i.e. dupilumab and oral JAK inhibitors). Among patients with a baseline IGA score of 3, EASI >= 16, and BSA >= 10% in the pooled population, 31 and 28 patients continued in the LTS period in the ruxolitinib 0.75% and 1.5% cream arms, respectively, and were evaluated for disease control. The proportion of patients who had no AD lesions or only minimal AD lesions (IGA score of 0/1) ranged from 48.4% to 82.8% from weeks 12 to 52 in patients who applied ruxolitinib 0.75% cream and from 62.5% to 91.3% in patients who applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream. During the LTS, measured mean total affected BSA ranged from 3.0% to 5.5% in patients who applied ruxolitinib 0.75% cream and from 2.5% to 4.8% in patients who applied ruxolitinib 1.5% cream. A safety analysis included patients who received ruxolitinib 0.75% (n=39) or ruxolitinib 1.5% (n=36) cream in any period of the TRuE-AD studies. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 28 (71.8%) and 24 (66.7%) patients who applied ruxolitinib 0.75% and 1.5% cream, respectively. Application site reactions remained infrequent during the LTS period (ruxolitinib 0.75% cream, n=1; ruxolitinib 1.5% cream, n=2). Treatment-related AEs were reported in six patients in each ruxolitinib cream group (15.4% for ruxolitinib 0.75% cream; 16.7% for ruxolitinib 1.5% cream); none was serious. No patient in either ruxolitinib cream arm discontinued from the study because of an AE. In summary, patients with more severe AD achieved long-term disease control with ruxolitinib cream monotherapy during the 52-week study period. Ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated in the long-term setting in this subset of patients who may be eligible for both systemic and topical therapies. Taken together, these data suggest that ruxolitinib cream may delay or prevent the need for systemic therapy in a subset of patients with more severe AD.",Simpson E.L.; Kircik L.; Blauvelt A.; Kuligowski M.E.; Venturanza M.E.; Sun K.; Eichenfield L.F.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.20648,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.20648,

In total, 692 patients were randomized to upadacitinib 30mg once daily (n=348) vs. dupilumab 300mg every 2weeks (n=344). The primary endpoint of Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 at week 16 demonstrated upadacitinib superiority vs. dupilumab (71.0% vs. 61.1%; P=0.006). All ranked secondary endpoints also supported upadacitinib superiority (nominal P<0.001): percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS; 66.9% vs. 49.0%) plus proportion of patients achieving EASI-100 (27.9% vs. 7.6%) and EASI-90 (60.6% vs. 38.8%) at week 16; percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS (59.5% vs. 31.7%) at week 4; proportion of patients achieving EASI-75 (43.6% vs. 17.5%) at week 2; percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS (31.4% vs. 8.8%) at week 1; and Worst Pruritus NRS improvement >= 4 (55.2% vs. 35.9%) at week 16. At week 24, numerically greater proportions of upadacitinib-treated than dupilumab-treated patients achieved EASI-75 (64.2% vs. 59.5%), EASI-90 (55.6% vs. 47.6%) and EASI-100 (27.3% vs. 13.1%), with greater mean improvement from baseline Worst Pruritus NRS (63.1% vs. 54.7%). The most striking differences for upadacitinib vs. dupilumab were in rapidity of response and ability to achieve higher levels of skin clearance (EASI-90 and EASI-100).

Long-term dupilumab treatment up to 100weeks reduces serum biomarkers in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) is a chemotactic factor for T helper 2 cells and eosinophils, which are important in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. Serum TARC and total IgE levels correlate with AD disease severity. Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation in multiple diseases. We report the impact of long-term dupilumab treatment on TARC and IgE levels in adults with moderate-to-severe AD in a phase III open-label extension (OLE) trial. The ongoing LIBERTY AD OLE study (NCT01949311) assesses long-term safety and efficacy of 300mg dupilumab weekly in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who previously participated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies. We present TARC and total IgE data of patients treated for up to 100weeks in the OLE study. Data were analysed descriptively based on available samples at individual timepoints. TARC and IgE levels were assessed in 288 patients treated up to 100weeks (data cutoff 1 December 2018). Median baseline parent study/OLE levels were 2483.3/1463.4pgmL-1 for TARC (n=280/288) and 3051.0/1,532.5 kU mL-1 for total IgE (n=259/249). Median TARC levels reduced rapidly within the first month of the OLE, with levels stabilizing from week 52 through to week 100; median percentage reduction in TARC concentration from parent study baseline (PSBL) was-73.3%,-79.7%,-87.0% and-85.5% at OLE weeks 2, 4, 52 and 100, respectively (n=282, n=285, n=284 and n=288, respectively). Median IgE levels reduced steadily through OLE week 52, with a further incremental decline seen at week 100; median percentage reductions in total IgE levels from PSBL were-38.5%,-80.4% and-87.6% at OLE weeks 4, 52 and 100 OLE, respectively (n=237, n=270 and n=288). The biomarker reductions were accompanied by improvements in median Eczema Area and Severity Index {decreased from 28.9 [interquartile range (IQR) 20.1-39.6] at PSBL [n=288] to 1.0 [IQR 0.0-2.7] at OLE week 100 [n=288]} and median Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score [decreased from 6.5 (IQR 5.2-8.0) at PSBL (n=283) to 2.0 (IQR 1.0-3.0) at OLE week 100 (n=189)]. Safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile. Long-term dupilumab treatment resulted in a>70% reduction in TARC as early as week 2, which was further reduced by weeks 4, 52 and 100; total IgE decreased more slowly, achieving a>80% reduction by week 52.

25854 Effects on type 2 immunity when specifically targeting the interleukin-13 cytokine with tralokinumab,,"Interleukin (IL)-13 is a key driver of the skin inflammation seen in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the IL-13 cytokine with high affinity, preventing interaction with the type 2 (IL-13 receptor[R]alpha1/IL-4Ralpha) receptor complex and subsequent IL-13 signaling. Tralokinumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in three Phase 3 trials. We investigated the effects of specific IL-13 targeting in randomly selected patients (n = 309) enrolled in the ECZTRA 1 trial, treated with either tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) [n = 233] or placebo (n = 76), who had blood samples taken that were analyzed for key serum biomarkers. Treatment with tralokinumab q2w resulted in a statistically significant percentage decrease in key T helper 2 (Th2) biomarkers of AD and atopy, such as chemokine ligand (CCL)17/thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine and periostin from baseline to week 4, and at week 16 (75% and 34% vs 41% and 16% for placebo, respectively) [both P <.0001]. Tralokinumab treatment also reduced other Th2-related chemokines, including CCL13, CCL17, CCL22, and CCL26. The serum concentrations of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) also showed a significant reduction at week 16 vs baseline. The reduced levels of CCL17 and IgE support the hypothesis that neutralization of the IL-13 cytokine alone may suffice to prevent Th2 signaling, allowing for modulation of type 2 immunity, including a decrease in IgE, without the need for direct blocking of the IL-4 pathway.Copyright © 2021",Guttman-Yassky E.; Kabashima K.; Pavel A.; Staumont-Salle D.,,0190-9622,/10.1016/j.jaad.2021.06.314,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaad.2021.06.314,
28186 Efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in North American adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: A subanalysis of the ECZTRA 2 trial,,"Background: Two double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational, 52-week (wk) trials demonstrated efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (ECZTRA 1, ECZTRA 2). This subanalysis examined efficacy and safety outcomes in North American patients in the ECZTRA 2 trial. Type of Study: Phase 3 subanalysis. Method(s): The ECZTRA 2 trial enrolled 794 patients worldwide. Enrolment was stratified by baseline disease severity and region and included 361 (45%) patients from North America (Canada and the US). Patients were randomized 3:1 to tralokinumab 300mg Q2W or placebo for 16wks. Co-primary efficacy outcomes were Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 at wk16. Adverse events were collected throughout the study period. Result(s): North American patients were 53.7% White, 24.9% Asian, 15.8% Black or African American, and 5.6% other. This population had slightly less severe disease than the overall study population, with mean baseline body surface area (BSA) affected and EASI score of 43.9% and 28.4, respectively, and 43.2% had severe disease (IGA-4). North American patients had lower prior use of conventional systemic immunosuppressants compared with the overall study population. At wk16, IGA-0/1 responses were 25.9% (tralokinumab) vs 14.3% (placebo; P =.021) and EASI-75 responses were 40.4% vs 15.4% (P <.001). Rescue medications were used by 18.1% (tralokinumab) and 41.8% (placebo) of patients. Overall adverse event rate was similar between tralokinumab and placebo over 16wks.

27603 Rapid itch relief with abrocitinib predicts later skin clearance: A post hoc analysis vs dupilumab and placebo in JADE COMPARE,,"Background: Rapid itch response is a desirable treatment goal for atopic dermatitis (AD). In JADE-COMPARE, more patients had clinically meaningful itch relief (>=4-point improvement in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [PP-NRS4]) at week 2 with abrocitinib 200 mg (49.1%) vs dupilumab (26.4%) and placebo (13.8%) and with abrocitinib 100 mg (31.8%) vs placebo (all comparisons, P<=0.0002). We investigated itch response from days 2-15 and relationships between week 2 PP-NRS4 response and week 12 response of >=90% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90). Method(s): In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 JADE-COMPARE trial (NCT03720470), adults with moderate-to-severe AD received once-daily abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks, or placebo, with background medicated topical therapy for 16 weeks. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to analyze PP-NRS4 response, and 2x2 tables were used to evaluate relationships between week 2 PP-NRS4 response and week 12 EASI-90 response. Result(s): A greater proportion of patients achieved PP-NRS4 with abrocitinib 200 mg vs dupilumab beginning at day 4 (18.6% vs 5.6%; P <.0001) continuing through day 15. Week 12 EASI-90 responses were greater in abrocitinib-treated patients who achieved a PP-NRS4 response at week 2 (58%, 51%, 35% for abrocitinib 200 mg, 100 mg, and dupilumab, respectively) than in those who did not (36%, 31%, 35%, respectively).

"28170 Neutralizing interleukin-13 increases skin microbial diversity: Results from a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with tralokinumab in adult patients with atopic dermatitis",,"A healthy skin barrier supports the growth of commensal bacteria, which protect the host from pathogenic bacteria and virulence factors. In atopic dermatitis (AD), recent studies have pointed to a lack of microbial diversity in lesional and nonlesional skin. Dysregulation of the skin microflora in AD is believed to be influenced by epidermal barrier disruption and Th2-driven inflammation, in which interleukin (IL)-13 plays a major role. Tralokinumab is a first-in-class, fully human monoclonal antibody that has proven efficacious in improving signs and symptoms in moderate-to-severe AD by neutralizing the IL-13 cytokine. Here, we investigate the change in microbial diversity in lesional skin of AD patients treated with tralokinumab in a Phase 3 clinical trial (ECZTRA 1; NCT03131648). Briefly, patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 3:1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo treatment every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. Skin swabs collected at baseline and after 8 weeks and 16 weeks of treatment were assessed for microbial diversity by DNA sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA. Treatment with tralokinumab was associated with an increase in skin microbial diversity compared with placebo. This supports the notion that neutralization of IL-13 contributes to improving the hallmarks of AD by breaking the cycle of itching, scratching, skin barrier dysfunction, and immune-mediated inflammation, thereby shifting the microbial diversity on AD lesional skin towards a commensal flora. Whether lack of microbial diversity in AD is a net result of epidermal barrier defect or a cause of barrier dysfunction and inflammation remains elusive.Copyright © 2021",Bieber T.; Beck L.A.; Pink A.; Saeki H.; Eichenfield L.; Werfel T.; Rosholm A.; Ropke M.; Paller A.,,0190-9622,/10.1016/j.jaad.2021.06.722,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaad.2021.06.722,

Here we examine patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Method(s): In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, adults aged >=18 years with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 2:2:2:1 to receive 16 weeks of treatment with oral abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg once daily, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, or placebo, plus background topical therapy. PROs were Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Night Time Itch Scale (NTIS) severity. Result(s): Analysis included 837 patients. At week 16, the proportion achieving POEM <3 was 21.3% for abrocitinib 200 mg, 11.7% for abrocitinib 100 mg, 12.4% for dupilumab, and 4.8% for placebo (abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg vs placebo, P <.0001 and P =.0350, respectively).

We investigated the efficacy of abrocitinib among adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were dupilumab nonresponders. Method(s): In JADE-COMPARE (NCT03720470), adult nonresponders after 16 weeks of dupilumab treatment (600 mg subcutaneous loading dose, then 300 mg every 2 weeks with background medicated topical therapy) underwent a 4-week washout period and were then randomized to receive oral abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg once daily (background topical therapy at patient/investigator discretion) in a double-blind, phase 3, long-term extension study (JADE-EXTEND; NCT03422822). Dupilumab nonresponse was failure to achieve Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) response (clear [0] or almost clear [1] and >=2-grade improvement from baseline); failure to achieve >=75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75); or failure to achieve >=4-point improvement from baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4).

26839 Dupilumab with topical corticosteroids results in rapid and sustained improvement in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis across all anatomic regions over 52 weeks,,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects different anatomic regions; some adults may exhibit more localized AD, such as head and neck involvement. We analyzed the extent of improvement in AD signs across different anatomic regions at Week 52 using data from the phase 3 dupilumab trial, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS (NCT02260986). Method(s): Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:3 to dupilumab 300 mg with topical corticosteroids (TCS) every 2 weeks (q2w+TCS) or placebo+TCS for 52 weeks. Least squares mean percent change (standard error) in Eczema Area and Severity Index by anatomic region is reported. Result(s): 421 patients were analyzed (q2w+TCS, n = 106; placebo+TCS, n = 315). Significant improvements in all signs in all body regions occurred as early as Week 4 (P <.05). Erythema improvement at Week 52 (q2w+TCS vs placebo+TCS) was: head and neck -65.1(4.9)/-35.1(2.9); trunk -72.7(4.1)/-41.7(2.5); upper extremities -70.5(4.1)/-39.2(2.5); and lower extremities -75.7(5.1)/-40.9(3.1). Infiltration/papulation improvement at Week 52 (q2w+TCS vs placebo+TCS) was: head and neck -66.0(5.9)/-40.0(3.5); trunk -78.1(4.4)/-44.2(2.6); upper extremities -76.6(4.2)/-41.1(2.5); and lower extremities -80.4(6.0)/-42.1(3.6).

405 Dupilumab normalizes expression of type 2 inflammatory genes,,"Background: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study (NCT02379052), adults with active eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) were randomized 1:1 to receive 12 weeks of subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw) or placebo. We analyzed the effect of dupilumab on the expression of type 2 inflammatory genes in the esophagus. Method(s): Biopsies were collected from the proximal, mid, and distal esophagus at baseline and Week 12 (n = 41). Mean esophageal gene expression for each patient was compared with the published EoE and healthy transcriptomes. A relative >= 2-fold change from baseline, q <= 0.05, was considered significant. To test the effects of dupilumab on type 2 inflammatory genes, normalized enrichment scores (NES) based on curated gene sets were generated from this study and published studies of other atopic indications (atopic dermatitis [AD], asthma, chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]). Result(s): The type 2 inflammatory genes' NES were significantly increased in tissues from patients with AD/asthma/CRSwNP/EoE compared with healthy controls. Dupilumab 300 mg qw modulated 1,302 genes and significantly normalized the expression of genes associated with type 2 inflammation, eosinophils, and mast cells in EoE patients. The post-dupilumab transcriptome more closely resembled that of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): Dupilumab reversed the EoE disease transcriptional signature and normalized the expression of multiple genes upregulated across many type 2 inflammatory diseases, confirming the congruence of the mechanism of action of dupilumab and the mechanism of disease.Copyright © 2021",Hamilton J.D.; Collins M.H.; Lim W.; Hamon S.; Wipperman M.F.; Radin A.; Chehade M.; Hirano I.; Dellon E.S.; Harel S.; Patel K.; Rothenberg M.E.,,0022-202X,/10.1016/j.jid.2021.02.428,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1016%2fj.jid.2021.02.428,
Early and sustained improvements in patientreported outcomes with tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids as needed in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczematous skin lesions associated with intense itch, sleep loss, impaired quality of life, anxiety and depression. Interleukin (IL)-13 is a key driver of the underlying type 2 inflammation and skin barrier dysfunction in AD. Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the IL-13 cytokine with high affinity, preventing interaction with the IL-13 receptor and subsequent downstream IL-13 signalling. The pivotal ECZTRA 3 trial (NCT03363854) investigated the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab plus topical corticosteroids (TCS) as needed in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. This analysis assessed the effects of treatment with tralokinumab plus TCS as needed on patient-reported outcomes over 32 weeks. ECZTRA 3 was a double-blind, phase III trial with placebo and TCS controls. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 2 : 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) plus TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% cream applied once daily to active lesions as needed; n = 252) or placebo plus TCS (n = 126) for 16 weeks. Thereafter, tralokinumab-treated patients continued with dosing either q2w or every 4 weeks (q4w) plus TCS for an additional 16 weeks. Worst daily pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS) and eczema-related sleep interference NRS were recorded daily via eDiary, and scores for the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were recorded during scheduled visits. Post hoc analyses of week 16 to week 32 data were conducted by pooling all patients who were randomized to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period, irrespectively of the tralokinumab dosing regimen beyond week 16. Statistical analyses followed prespecifications, namely a mixed model for repeated measures with fixed effects of planned treatment, region and baseline Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA); and interactions between treatment and visit, and baseline value and visit for continuous endpoints. Data after rescue medication or permanent discontinuation of trial product were set to missing, and a compound symmetric covariance matrix was assumed for repeated measures of a patient. At week 16, the mean worst daily pruritus NRS (weekly average) improved by -4.1 compared with baseline with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS and by -3.0 with placebo plus TCS [difference -1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.6 to -0.7; P < 0.001); mean eczema-related sleep interference NRS improved by -4.4 with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS vs. -3.2 with placebo plus TCS (difference -1.2, 95% CI -1.7 to -0.7; P < 0.001); and mean POEM improved by -11.8 with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS vs. -7.8 with placebo plus TCS (difference -4.0, 95% CI -5.6 to -2.4; P < 0.001). The least squares mean (SE) HADS total score improved from 11.6 (0.3) at baseline to 7.2 (0.3) at week 16 with tralokinumab q2w vs. 9.2 (0.4) with placebo plus TCS (difference -2.0, 95% CI -3.1 to -1.0; P < 0.001). The least squares mean DLQI total score was reduced from 17.4 (0.3) at baseline to 5.6 (0.3) at week 16 with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS vs. 8.3 (0.5) with placebo plus TCS (difference -2.7, 95% CI -3.9 to -1.5; P < 0.001). Early separation in all patient-reported outcomes between tralokinumab plus TCS and placebo plus TCS was observed from week 2 or 3 onward. At weeks 15-16, tralokinumab-treated patients used approximately 50% less TCS than did placebotreated patients (P = 0.002). Continued tralokinumab q2w or q4w + TCS was associated with sustained improvements over baseline at week 32 in worst daily pruritus NRS [estimated mean change (SE) of -4.6 (0.1)], eczema-related sleep interference NRS [-4.9 (0.1)] and POEM [-12.4 (0.5)]. Similarly, sustained improvements were observed at week 32 in DLQI [estimated total score (SE) of 5.1 (0.3)] and HADS [6.4 (0.3)]. In conclusion, patients with moderate-to-severe AD receiving tralokinumab plus TCS as needed reported early and sustained improvements in itch, sleep interference, POEM, anxiety, depression and QoL. The impact of AD on patients' QoL was reduced from having a very large effect (mean DLQI total score >= 11) at baseline to a small effect (mean DLQI total < 6) at week 32. In addition, symptoms of anxiety and depression, as reported by the patients, improved from abnormal at baseline (mean HADS total score >= 11) to normal (mean < 8) at week 32.",Elewski B.E.; Stander S.; Zirwas M.; Silvestre J.F.; Kalia S.; Gutermuth J.; Mark T.; Tindberg A.M.; Silverberg J.I.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.19722,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.19722,

Post hoc analyses of week 16 to week 32 data were conducted by pooling all patients who were randomized to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period (weeks 0-16; n = 252) irrespectively of what dosing regimen (q2w or q4w) they received beyond week 16. Statistical analyses followed prespecifications, namely Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel stratified by region and baseline Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) for binary endpoints, and mixed model for repeated measures with fixed effects of planned treatment, region, baseline IGA, and interactions between treatment and visit, and baseline value and visit for continuous endpoints. Missing data or data after rescue medication were imputed as nonresponse for binary endpoints. For continuous endpoints, data after rescue medication or permanent discontinuation of trial treatment were set to missing, and a compound symmetric covariance matrix was assumed for repeated measures of a patient. At week 16, significantly more patients achieved >= 50% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 50) [79.4 vs. 57.9%; difference of 21.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.3-31.3; P < 0.001], EASI 75 (56.0 vs. 35.7%; difference of 20.2%, 95% CI 9.8-30.6; P < 0.001) and EASI 90 (32.9 vs. 21.4%; difference of 11.4%, 95% CI 2.1-20.7; P = 0.022) with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS vs. placebo plus TCS. The EASI 50 response rate was sustained through week 32 (81.0%; 204 of 252); the EASI 75 response rate progressively increased to 69.0% (174 of 252) at week 24 and was sustained through week 32 (70.2%; 177 of 252); and the EASI 90 response rate progressively increased throughout the continuation period to 50.4% (127 of 252) at week 32. At week 16, least squares mean (SE) EASI scores were reduced from 29.0 (0.5) at baseline to 8.0 (0.5) with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS vs. 13.0 (0.8) with placebo plus TCS (difference -5.1, 95% -6.9 to -3.2; P < 0.001), the and mean (SE) SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) was reduced from 67.3 (1.0) at baseline to 29.2 (1.0) with tralokinumab q2w plus TCS and to 39.5 (1.5) with placebo plus TCS (difference -10.3, 95% CI -13.8 to -6.8; P < 0.001). At week 32, further improvements were seen with continued tralokinumab plus TCS in EASI [estimated mean (SE) of 4.6 (0.5)] and SCORAD [estimated mean (SE) of 21.8 (1.0)], corresponding to mean changes from baseline of 84% (EASI) and 68% (SCORAD). The cumulative use of TCS at the end of the initial treatment period (week 16) was lower in the tralokinumab group than in the placebo group: mean (SE) 134.9 g (11.7) vs. 193.5 g (16.7); P = 0.004). At weeks 15-16, tralokinumab- treated patients used approximately 50% less TCS than placebo-treated patients (P = 0.002), and 53% of tralokinumab- treated patients used no or very limited amounts (0-5 g) of TCS. In conclusion, tralokinumab plus TCS as needed provided significant improvements in the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis compared with placebo plus TCS as needed at week 16 in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The week 16 response rates progressively improved with continued use of tralokinumab plus TCS, with 70% of patients achieving EASI 75 at week 32. The extent and severity of atopic dermatitis were reduced from mean EASI and SCORAD scores equivalent to severe disease at baseline to mild at week 32.",Alexis A.F.; Zirwas M.; Pinter A.; Adam D.N.; Chiricozzi A.; Pink A.E.; Mark T.; Tindberg A.M.; Silverberg J.I.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.19722,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.19722,
Tralokinumab prevents flares in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Post hoc analyses of a randomized phase III clinical trial (ECZTRA 3),,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by periods of acute symptomatic worsening (flares). Tralokinumab is a fully human, high-affinity, monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralizes interleukin (IL)-13 cytokine, a key driver of cutaneous barrier dysfunction, inflammation and dysbiosis in AD. Severe AD flares often prompt rescue therapy with high-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS), systemic steroids and antibiotics, and can lead to both emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Flare prevention is a primary goal for long-term control of AD. Flares are commonly defined as a worsening of AD requiring treatment intensification or escalation (i.e. addition of highpotency TCS, oral corticosteroids or immunosuppressants) that may impact the flare frequency measured, particularly in moderate- to-severe AD. In this study, we assessed the impact of tralokinumab treatment on flare prevention in adults with moderate to-severe AD. ECZTRA III was a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial in adults with moderate-to-severe AD (NCT03363854).1 Patients were treated with either 300 mg tralokinumab (n = 252) or placebo (n = 126) every 2 weeks (Q2W) in combination with TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% cream applied on lesional skin as needed) for an initial 16 weeks. Thereafter, patients treated with tralokinumab continued on treatment either Q2W or Q4W plus TCS for an additional 16 weeks. AD flares, defined as worsening of the disease that required escalation/intensification of AD treatment including initiation or intensification of the supplied TCS ('per protocol flare'), were measured throughout the trial (32 weeks). We present post hoc analyses of flare occurrence, as defined by treatment intensification to either high-potency TCS, oral corticosteroids and other systemic treatments ('rescue flare'). Reports of adverse events (AEs) that included 'dermatitis atopic' or 'dermatitis infected' were analysed to reflect AD worsening to a degree beyond normal fluctuation ('AE flare'). Time to first flare was analysed using a Cox proportional hazard model stratified by region and baseline Investigator's Global Assessment with planned treatment as covariate. Treatment groups were well balanced with respect to AD severity at baseline (week 0). Overall, seven patients (2.8%) reported a 'rescue flare' in the tralokinumab plus TCS group compared with 13 patients (10%) in the placebo plus TCS group during the first 16 weeks, corresponding to a 74% risk reduction with tralokinumab [hazard ratio (HR) 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.10-0.65; P = 0.004]. Similarly, six (2.4%) patients reported an 'AE flare' in the tralokinumab plus TCS group vs. 14 patients (11%) with placebo plus TCS during the first 16 weeks, corresponding to an 80% risk reduction with tralokinumab (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.53; P = 0.001). The risk of a 'rescue flare' or 'AE flare' (whichever occurred first) was 77% lower with tralokinumab (HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.50; P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with a 'per protocol flare' during the initial 16-week treatment period was numerically lower in the tralokinumab plus TCS group (28%, 70 of 252) compared with the placebo please TCS group [34% (43 of 126); HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.54-1.16]. Among patients who received tralokinumab plus TCS during the entire 32-week treatment period, the majority [65% (163 of 252)] did not report a 'per protocol flare', and nearly all did not report a 'rescue flare' [96% (241 of 252)] or an 'AE flare' [94% (236 of 252)] during the 32 weeks. The cumulative amount of TCS used was approximately 30% lower in tralokinumab plus TCS group compared with the placebo plus TCS group, both in the overall population and among patients who reported a 'per protocol flare' between week 0 and week 16. Tralokinumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of AD flares when used in combination with TCS in adults with moderateto- severe AD. Most patients who received tralokinumab plus TCS during the entire 32-week treatment period remained flare-free.",Silverberg J.I.; Barbarot S.; Welzel J.; Ameen M.; Thyssen J.P.; Lomaga M.; Kurre Olsen C.; Mark T.; Corriveau J.; Merola J.F.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.19722,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.19722,
A phase III study to investigate the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib and dupilumab in comparison with placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Systemic therapies with favourable benefit-risk profiles are necessary for long-term disease control in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) that is unresponsive to topical agents. Not all patients have an adequate response with dupilumab, and some patients develop conjunctivitis or prefer oral therapy. The primary study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of once-daily abrocitinib (200 mg or 100 mg) with that of placebo in patients with AD on background medicated topical therapy. Key secondary objectives were to compare itch response for abrocitinib and dupilumab at 2 weeks and to estimate the proportion of patients with improved AD signs in the three active treatment arms. Adults with moderate-tosevere AD [Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) >= 3, Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) (used with permission of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sanofi) score >= 4, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score >= 16 and percentage of body surface area affected >= 10] were randomly assigned 2 : 2 : 2 : 1 to receive oral abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg once daily, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks after a 600-mg loading dose (plus oral placebo once daily or placebo subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks as appropriate), or placebo, along with background medicated topical therapy (low- or medium-potency topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors or phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors) for 16 weeks for active lesions. Coprimary [IGA response of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with >= 2-grade improvement and >= 75% improvement in EASI (EASI 75) response at week 12] and key secondary endpoints [PP-NRS4 response (>= 4-point improvement) at week 2 and IGA and EASI 75 responses at week 16] were analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted by baseline disease severity and controlled for multiplicity. In the abrocitinib 200-mg, 100-mg, dupilumab and placebo arms, 226, 238, 242 and 131 patients were treated, respectively. Of these patients, 89.3-92.1% completed 16 weeks of therapy. Median age was 34.0 years; 51.1% of patients were female, 72.4% were white and 21.3% were Asian. Median (Q1, Q3) AD duration was 21.8 years (9.5, 32.5) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score was 15.0 (11.0, 21.0). Mean (SD) EASI score was 30.9 (12.8), PP-NRS score was 7.3 (1.7) and 35.4% had severe IGA. At week 12, the proportion of patients achieving IGA and EASI 75 response was significantly higher with abrocitinib than with placebo (P < 0.001). IGA response was 48.4% for abrocitinib 200 mg, 36.6% for 100 mg, 36.5% for dupilumab and 14.0% for placebo; EASI 75 response was 70.3%, 58.7%, 58.1% and 27.1%, respectively. At week 2, the proportion achieving PP-NRS4 response was significantly higher with abrocitinib 200 mg than with dupilumab (P < 0.001): 49.1% for abrocitinib 200 mg, 31.8% for 100 mg, 26.4% for dupilumab, and 13.8% for placebo. At week 16, the proportion achieving IGA and EASI 75 response was significantly higher with abrocitinib than with placebo (P < 0.001). IGA response was 47.5% for abrocitinib 200 mg, 34.8% for 100 mg, 38.8% for dupilumab and 12.9% for placebo; EASI 75 response was 71.0%, 60.3%, 65.5% and 30.6%, respectively. For abrocitinib 200 mg, 100 mg, dupilumab, and placebo, median time to PP-NRS4 response was 13 days, 29 days, 31 days and 'not evaluable', respectively. At week 12, the proportion of patients achieving PP-NRS4 response (abrocitinib 200 mg, 100 mg, dupilumab and placebo) was 63.1%, 47.5%, 54.5% and 28.9%, respectively; PP-NRS < 2 response was 36.9%, 21.1%, 24.9% and 7.4%, respectively; DLQI < 2 response was 29.7%, 21.9%, 22.5% and 8.6%, respectively; >= 90% improvement in EASI was 46.1%, 36.6%, 34.9% and 10.1%, respectively. More patients in the 200-mg arm experienced adverse events (AEs); in the abrocitinib 200 mg, 100 mg, dupilumab, and placebo groups, the proportion was 61.9%, 50.8%, 50.0% and 53.4%, respectively. There was a similar proportion of patients with serious or severe AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation across treatment arms (all < 5%). This study shows the efficacy and safety of both abrocitinib doses through 16 weeks combined with background medicated topical therapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Abrocitinib 200 mg provided significantly faster itch relief than dupilumab. Through 12 weeks, the rate of improvement in AD signs was similar between dupilumab and abrocitinib 100 mg and was higher with abrocitinib 200 mg. By week 16, the responder rate was highest for abrocitinib 200 mg, followed by dupilumab and abrocitinib 100 mg.

Early changes in patient-relevant endpoints in three tralokinumab pivotal phase III trials (ECZTRA 1-3) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease with substantial symptom burden, including itch, pain and sleep disturbance. Tralokinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, specifically neutralizes interleukin-13, a key cytokine in AD inflammation. Phase III trials investigated tralokinumab vs. placebo (ECZTRA 1, NCT03131648; ECZTRA 2, NCT03160885) and combination tralokinumab plus topical corticosteroids (TCS) vs. placebo and TCS (ECZTRA 3, NCT03363854). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were used to assess the benefits of these treatment regimens. The objective of this analysis was to examine early changes in PROs across ECZTRA 1/2 and ECZTRA 3. Patients were randomized 3 : 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo every 2 weeks (ECZTRA 1/2) or 2 : 1 to subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg + TCS or placebo every 2 weeks + TCS (ECZTRA 3) for an initial 16 weeks. PROs included daily numerical rating scale (NRS) eczema-related sleep interference, worst daily pruritus, biweekly (to week 8, and then at weeks 12 and 16) Patient- Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In total, 802, 794 and 380 patients were randomized in ECZTRA 1 2, and 3, respectively. Significantly more patients achieved the primary endpoints of Investigator's Global Assessment 0/1 and EASI 75 (>= 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index) at 16 weeks with tralokinumab than with placebo in all three studies. Tralokinumab, compared with placebo, reduced the weekly mean eczema-related sleep interference from baseline by week 1 in ECZTRA 1 (-0.6 vs. -0.2; P < 0.001) and ECZTRA 2 (-0.7 vs. -0.2; P < 0.001), and by week 2 in ECZTRA 3 (-2.3 vs. -1.9; P = 0.037). Tralokinumab vs. placebo improved weekly average NRS worst daily pruritus from baseline by week 1 in ECZTRA 1 (-0.7 vs. -0.2; P < 0.001) and ECZTRA 2 (-0.7 vs. -0.3; P < 0.001), and by week 3 in ECZTRA 3 (-2.6 vs. -2.0; P = 0.003). By week 2, tralokinumab vs. placebo reduced mean POEM in ECZTRA 1 (-4.0 vs. -1.3; P < 0.001), ECZTRA 2 (-4.6 vs. -1.6; P < 0.001) and ECZTRA 3 (-7.9 vs. -5.9; P = 0.006), and also reduced mean DLQI in ECZTRA 1 (-4.4 vs. -2.5; P < 0.001), ECZTRA 2 (-4.7 vs. -2.2; P < 0.001) and ECZTRA 3 (-8.9 vs. -7.3; P = 0.011). Mean improvements from baseline for DLQI and POEM reached the minimally clinical important difference at week 2. In conclusions, tralokinumab, with or without concomitant TCS, led to rapid improvements in PROs across three trials. Concomitant TCS use in ECZTRA 3 may explain why differences between tralokinumab and placebo were observed earlier in ECZTRA 1/2.",Silverberg J.I.; Cork M.; Wollenberg A.; Katoh N.; Steffensen L.A.; Kurbasic A.; Olsen C.K.; Kuznetsova A.; Osterdal M.L.; Vilsboll A.W.; Deleuran M.; Simpson E.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.19722,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.19722,
Long-term Dupilumab treatment up to 100 weeks reduces serum biomarkers in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Objectives: Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) is a chemotactic factor for Th2 cells and eosinophils, which are impor-tant in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. Serum TARC and total IgE levels correlate with AD disease severity. Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for in-terleukin-4 and interleukin-13, key and central drivers of type 2 in-flammation in multiple diseases. We report the impact of long-term dupilumab treatment on TARC and IgE levels in adults with moder-ate-to-severe AD in a phase 3, open-label extension (OLE) trial. Method(s): The LIBERTY AD OLE study (NCT01949311) assessed long-term safety and efficacy of 300 mg dupilumab/week in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who previously participated in a ran-domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (RDBPC) parent studies (PS). We present TARC and total IgE data of patients treated for up to 100 weeks. Data were analysed descriptively based on available samples at individual timepoints. Result(s): At data cutoff (December 1, 2018), TARC and IgE levels were assessed in 288 patients treated up to 100 weeks. Median baseline RDBPC PS/OLE levels were 2,483.3/1,463.4 pg/mL for TARC (n = 280/288) and 3,051.0/1,532.5 kU/mL for total IgE Conclusion(s): The number of PIDs diagnosed in two groups was equal. The patient diagnosed with CVID was negative for the con-ventional PID warning signs. Our study had several limitations like the design. The workload during the pandemic and the need for prudent resourcing forced us to establish a narrow set of criteria (n = 259/249). Median TARC levels at Week 2/4/52/100 of OLE were 670.7/518.6/321.9/338.3 pg/mL (n = 282/285/284/288). Median total IgE levels at Week 4/52/100 of OLE were 1,228.9/408.0/275.5 kU/mL (n = 237/270/288). Median % reduction in TARC concentration from PS baseline was-73.3%/-87.0%/-85.5% at Week 2/52/100 of OLE. Median % reduction in total IgE concentration from PS baseline was-38.5%/-80.4%/-87.6% at Week 4/52/100 of OLE. Conclusion(s): Long-term dupilumab treatment resulted in >70% re-duction in TARC as early as Week 2 that was further reduced by Week 52 and Week 100; total IgE decreased more slowly, achieving >80% reduction by Week 52. These substantial and sustained reduc-tions were accompanied by sustained improvements in AD signs and symptoms (data previously published).",Beck L.A.; Thaci D.; Bissonette R.; Deleuran M.; Harel S.; McDonald R.; Shumel B.; Rossi A.B.,,1365-2222,/10.1111/cea.13812,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed22&DO=10.1111%2fcea.13812,
Depth and Rapidity of Response With Abrocitinib and Dupilumab in Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD) in JADE COMPARE,,"Rationale: Emerging treatments for moderate-to-severe AD could provide greater and faster improvement in AD signs and symptoms than current therapies. A post hoc analysis of stringent endpoints with abrocitinib and dupilumab was conducted using JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470) data. Method(s): Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned 2:2:2:1 to receive oral abrocitinib 200 or 100 mg once daily, subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks after a 600-mg loading dose, or placebo with background topical therapy for 16 weeks. Endpoints were improvement >=90% from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0, Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) score of 0, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0/1, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) sleep subscore <2, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score <3, and NightTime Itch Score (NTIS) <2. Result(s): Among 837 treated patients, the proportions who achieved stringent responses at week 16 (abrocitinib 200 mg, abrocitinib 100 mg, dupilumab vs placebo) were EASI-90 (48.9%, 38.0%, 38.8% vs 11.3%), IGA-0 (14.9%, 12.6%, 6.5% vs 4.8%), PtGA-0 (7.7%, 3.9%, 3.9% vs 1.6%), DLQI-0/1 (29.7%, 21.6%, 24.0% vs 10.6%), SCORAD sleep subscore <2 (68.4%, 52.8%, 58.5% vs 32.0%), POEM <3 (21.3%, 11.7%, 12.4% vs 4.8%), and NTIS <2 (57.1%, 44.5%, 46.1% vs 31.9%). Response rates at week 2 were higher with abrocitinib 200 mg than with dupilumab.

Patient-Reported Ocular Disorders and Symptoms in Adults with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: Screening and Baseline Survey Data from a Clinical Trial,,"Introduction: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have a greater risk of conjunctivitis and other ocular surface disorders than the general population. We evaluated the burden of ocular surface disorders and related symptoms prior to treatment initiation in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): Patients were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase 3 trial of dupilumab administered with concomitant topical corticosteroids. At the beginning of the screening period, all enrolled patients completed a survey of ocular disorder diagnoses received in the past year; at baseline, patients completed a survey of frequency and severity of ocular symptoms (discomfort, itching, redness, and tearing) experienced in the past month. Result(s): A total of 712 of 740 patients enrolled in the trial provided responses to the survey. At screening, 286 of 740 patients (38.6%) reported having at least one ocular disorder in the past year. At baseline, 499 of 712 respondents (70.1%) reported having at least one symptom within the past month. Of these patients, 4.4%, 6.0%, 5.5%, and 4.4%, respectively, reported having discomfort, itching, redness, and tearing all of the time. Mild discomfort, itching, redness, and tearing were reported by 26.1%, 33.7%, 30.8%, and 31.6% of patients, respectively, while 7.3%, 7.7%, 6.2%, and 4.2%, reported severe discomfort, itching, redness, and tearing, respectively. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate a high burden of ocular surface disorders and related symptoms in a population of adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Dermatologists should be aware of increased incidence of these disorders in AD and query their patients for signs and symptoms of eye disease.

"Laboratory safety of dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results from three phase III trials (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1, LIBERTY AD SOLO 2, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS)",,"Background: Dupilumab [a monoclonal antibody blocking the shared receptor subunit for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13] is approved for patients aged >= 12 years with inadequately controlled, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Dupilumab trials of up to 52 weeks demonstrated efficacy and a favourable safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe AD inadequately controlled with topical medications. Objective(s): To further characterize the safety of dupilumab by evaluating clinical laboratory findings from three randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III trials (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 & 2 and LIBERTY AD CHRONOS). Method(s): Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 (SOLO 1 & 2) or 3 : 1 : 3 (CHRONOS) for 16 and 52 weeks, respectively, to dupilumab weekly, every 2 weeks or placebo. CHRONOS patients received a standardized concomitant topical corticosteroid regimen. Laboratory outcomes were summarized descriptively in 1376 patients from SOLO 1 & 2 and 740 from CHRONOS. Result(s): Treatment groups had similar results in baseline laboratory parameters. Platelets and neutrophils showed mild decreases from baseline in dupilumab vs. placebo groups. Some dupilumab-treated patients had small transient increases in eosinophils. Grade 3 eosinophilia was reported in < 1% of dupilumab-treated and placebo-treated patients; no adverse events were associated with eosinophilia. Lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased from baseline during dupilumab treatment in all trials. No clinically meaningful changes were observed between treatment groups in other haematology, chemistry or urinalysis parameters. Conclusion(s): There were no clinically important changes in routine laboratory parameters that could be attributed to dupilumab. This study supports the use of dupilumab as a systemic treatment for moderate-to-severe AD that does not require laboratory monitoring. What's already known about this topic?. Long-term treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) with conventional immunosuppressive agents is limited by the risk of significant side-effects and a need for repeated tests to monitor haematological and/or organ (e.g. liver, kidney) toxicities. Dupilumab [a monoclonal antibody blocking the shared receptor subunit for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13] is approved for the treatment of patients with inadequately controlled, moderate-to-severe AD. In 16-week and 52-week studies, dupilumab demonstrated a positive risk/benefit profile in moderate-to-severe AD. What does this study add?. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of dupilumab laboratory safety data of the 16-week SOLO 1 & 2 (pooled N = 1376) and 52-week CHRONOS (N = 740) trials, demonstrating an absence of clinically important changes in haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis parameters in patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab. Our data support the use of dupilumab as a systemic treatment for the long-term management of moderate-to-severe AD without routine laboratory monitoring in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Rapid onset and long-term effect of dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) on objective scorad (O-scorad) in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD): Liberty ad chronos,,"INTRODUCTION: Dupilumab (anti-IL-4Ralpha) inhibits signaling of IL-4/IL-13, key drivers of type 2-mediated inflammation. Dupilumab is indicated for treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. Objective(s): To report the long-term effect of dupilumab+TCS on o-SCORAD in adults with moderate-to-severe AD (CHRONOS: NCT02260986). Material(s) and Method(s): 740 adults were randomized to receive dupilumab 300 mg plus TCS weekly (qw+TCS), every 2 weeks (q2w+TCS), or control (placebo+TCS) qw for 52 weeks. Outcomes included objective components of SCORAD: erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crust, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness, and Body Surface Area (BSA). Improvements were assessed by least squares mean percent change from baseline using ANCOVA model with baseline measurement, region, and baseline IGA stratum as covariates. Patients were censored after rescue treatment use; multiple imputation method was implemented for missing data. Result(s): Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Patients receiving dupilumab qw+TCS had improvements (reduction) vs control in excoriation by Week 1 (-26.9% vs-17.8%), and patients receiving q2w+TCS by Week 2 in excoriation (-41.8% vs-23.3%) and dryness (-25.3% vs-16.3%). Patients in both dupilumab treatment arms (qw+TCS/q2w+TCS vs control) had improvement in erythema (-27.2%/-26.2% vs-19.0%), edema/papulation (-30.0%/-32.3% vs-19.9%), and oozing/ crust (-49.9%/-55.9% vs-32.6%) by Week 2, and by Week 4 in lichenification (qw+TCS/q2w+TCS vs control,-31.1%/-34.7% vs-23.9%) and dryness (qw+TCS vs control,-34.2% vs-23.9%). All improvements remained through Week 52 (qw+TCS/q2w+TCS vs control): erythema,-51.0%/-48.9% vs-34.4%; edema/papulation,-63.7%/-57.8% vs-43.5%; oozing/crust,-89.9%/-85.1% vs-65.6%; excoriation,-78.6%/-72.8% vs-46.9%; lichenification,-67.4%/-69.9% vs-46.7%; dryness,-50.7%/-55.7% vs-36.5%.

Tralokinumab phase 2b study: Effects of the anti-interleukin-13 monoclonal antibody on staph. aureus skin colonisation and systemic levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with atopic dermatitis,,"INTRODUCTION: Tralokinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-13 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated significant improvements in Eczema Area Severity Score and in a greater percentage of patients with Investigator's Global Assessment score responses in a Phase 2b study (NCT02347176) in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective(s): To examine the effects of tralokinumab on Staphylococcus aureus (SA) abundance and inflammatory biomarkers in adults with AD in an exploratory analysis of data from the Phase 2b study. Material(s) and Method(s): 204 adults with moderate to severe AD were randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous tralokinumab 45, 150 or 300 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Concomitant Class 3 (World Health Organization) topical corticosteroids were administered at least once daily during a 2-week run-in and as needed throughout the treatment and follow-up periods. Exploratory measurements included changes in SA abundance and serum biomarkers, including chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), periostin and immunoglobulin E (IgE), from baseline to week 12. Result(s): At week 12, the percentage of SA-negative patients increased in a dose-dependent manner, reported in 50%, 55% and 62% of patients receiving tralokinumab 45, 150 and 300 mg, respectively, versus placebo (24%). Levels of CCL17 were reduced with tralokinumab 45 mg (-0.7%), 150 mg (-12.7%) and 300 mg (-40.0%), versus placebo (+37.4%). Similar dose-dependent reductions were seen with IgE (-6.80%, -17.0% and -22.3%, versus +1.7%, respectively) and periostin (-23.3%, -26.6 and -31.3, versus +1.9%, respectively). DDP-4 levels were minimally affected by treatment (+8.1%, +8.7% and +7.3%, versus +3.9%, respectively). The most-frequent treatment-emergent adverse event related to study drug was upper respiratory tract infection (3.9% in both pooled tralokinumab and placebo groups).

"Safety of dupilumab in moderate-tosevere atopic dermatitis patients inadequately controlled with, intolerant to, or inadvisable for cyclosporine-a: Laboratory findings from the liberty-ad-cafe trial",,"INTRODUCTION: Phase 3 studies of dupilumab (anti-IL-4Ralpha monoclonal antibody) demonstrated efficacy on multiple clinical endpoints and a favorable safety profile, including laboratory safety, in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) inadequately controlled with topical medications. Dupilumab is approved in the EU for treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. Objective(s): We report laboratory outcomes in patients with moderate-to-severe AD inadequately controlled with, intolerant to, or medically inadvisable for cyclosporine-A from the LIBERTY-AD-CAFE trial. Material(s) and Method(s): CAFE was a 16-week (Wk), randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled, phase 3 trial. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to dupilumab 300mg weekly (qw) or every 2 Wks (q2w) or placebo; patients received concomitant low-/medium-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS). Laboratory outcomes were summarized descriptively. Result(s): Safety was assessed in 325 patients. Treatment groups had similar baseline disease/laboratory characteristics. Small transient increases from baseline in eosinophils were observed in dupilumab+TCS-treated vs placebo+TCS-treated patients; with the highest mean increase observed at Wk8 for q2w+TCS (placebo+TCS/q2w+TCS/qw+TCS: 0.02/0.26/0.10 x109/L) and Wk12 for qw+TCS (placebo+TCS/q2w+TCS/qw+TCS:-0.02/0.20/0.15 x109/L). Incidences of eosinophilia (>=0.65x109/L) were similar across groups throughout treatment (placebo+TCS/q2w+TCS/qw+TCS: 49.1%/57.0%/50.9%). Severe eosinophilia (>5.0x109/L) was reported in one patient in q2w+TCS. Eosinophils returned to pre-baseline levels by Wk16. No clinical alterations were associated with eosinophilia. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a marker of tissue damage that correlates with AD disease activity and severity, showed a greater mean decrease from baseline through Wk16 in the dupilumab+TCS groups vs placebo+TCS group (placebo+TCS/q2w+TCS/qw+TCS:-6.9/-56.6/-62.6 U/L); mean LDH values in each group were within normal range throughout the study. No clinically meaningful changes were observed between treatment groups in other hematologic, chemistry, or urinalysis parameters.

"Lebrikizumab, a high-affinity interleukin-13 inhibitor, improves moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis regardless of patient race: Post hoc analysis from a phase IIb study",,"Background Interleukin (IL)-13 is a central pathogenic mediator driving multiple features of atopic dermatitis (AD). Lebrikizumab (LEB) is a novel high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting IL-13, which selectively prevents formation of the IL-13Ra1/IL-4Ra heterodimer receptor signalling complex. Although presentation of AD differs between racial subgroups, T helper (Th)2 cell activation occurs across race in AD. Objectives This post hoc analysis assessed the impact of patient race on LEB efficacy and safety from a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase IIb study in moderate-to-severe AD (NCT03443024). Methods Adults with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) = 16, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) = 3, = 10% body surface area (BSA) affected, and chronic AD for = 1 year were randomized 3: 3: 3: 2 to subcutaneous LEB 125 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) [250-mg loading dose (LD), n = 73], 250 mg q4w (500-mg LD, n = 80), 250 mg q2w (500-mg LD at week 0 and week 2, n = 75), or placebo q2w (n = 52) for 16 weeks, with a 16-week safety follow-up. Endpoints were assessed post hoc by race subgroup [white, black/African American, other (American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, multiple/other)]. The primary endpoint was percentage change in EASI from baseline to week 16. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving = 50%, 75% or 90% improvement from baseline in EASI (EASI 50, EASI 75 or EASI 90), IGA score 0 or 1, and pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) change = 4 points at week 16. Statistical comparisons were not performed for subgroups. Safety assessment included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results Race distribution for LEB 125 mg q4w, 250 mg q4w, 250 mg q2w vs. patients treated with placebo was as follows: white n = 37, n = 42, n = 40 vs. n = 26; black/African American n = 26, n = 28, n = 23 vs. n = 16; other n = 10, n = 10, n = 12 vs. n = 10, respectively. Baseline EASI and IGA scores were similar between subgroups and the overall population. All LEB groups showed dose-dependent statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint vs. placebo at week 16 [mean percentage change in EASI: LEB 125 mg q4w (-61.5%, P < 0.05), 250 mg q4w (-69.7%, P < 0.01), 250 mg q2w (72.8%, P < 0.001) vs. placebo (40.6%)]. Similar responses were generally observed across subgroups (white-69.8%,-68.7%,-73.6% vs.-47.4%; black/African American 48.4%, 69.3%,-73.0% vs.-34.8%; other-65.2%,-74.6%,-69.4% vs.-32.3%). Comparable efficacy was observed across subgroups, as a greater proportion of patients who received LEB 250 mg q4w and 250 mg q2w vs. patients who received placebo achieved EASI 50, EASI 75, EASI 90 and IGA 0/1. A greater proportion of patients who received LEB 250 mg q2w vs. patients treated with placebo achieved pruritus NRS change = 4 points (white 46.1%, 39.2%, 67.1% vs. 38.6%; black/African American 40.9%, 48.9%, 72.5% vs. 43.8%; other 40.6%, 67.7%, 57.3% vs. 34.0%). TEAEs were reported as follows: white 54.1%, 50.0%, 67.5% vs. 57.7%; black/African American 65.4%, 46.4%, 43.5% vs. 31.3% and other 50.0%, 50.0%, 75.0% vs. 40.0%. Most TEAEs were mild-to-moderate and did not lead to discontinuation. Across subgroups, TEAEs reported in = 5% (combined LEB group) were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection; cough and oropharyngeal pain also were observed in the 'other' race subgroup. Low rates of conjunctivitis and herpes infections were reported across race subgroups in patients treated with LEB. Conclusions In the overall population of this phase IIb study, the primary endpoint was met by all LEB groups, and LEB demonstrated a dose-dependent response across all endpoints measured, with marked improvement at both 250-mg q2w and q4w doses. LEB improved skin lesion and itch measures vs. placebo over 16 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe AD regardless of race.

Pruritus in epidermolysis bullosa,,"Defined as the unpleasant sensation leading to the need to scratch, pruritus also occurs in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) in whom it has even been described as one of the most bothersome complications. In all EB subtypes, healing wounds and/or certain body sites such as the legs and feet are the itchiest affected areas. However, itch profiles differ significantly according to EB subtype. Whereas pruritus scores in EB simplex are mild to moderate in most patients, other forms of EB are associated with higher itch severity, frequency and duration. Of note, patients with recessive dystrophic EB seem to be most severely affected suffering from the highest itch burden. The pathophysiology of pruritus in EB is very complex mostly involving non-histaminergic and, far less frequently, histaminergic pathways. Additionally, EB pruritogenesis involves keratinocytes, immune cells, sensory nerves as well as spinal cord and brain cells. Their itch signals are transmitted by extensive tissue crosstalk through cytokines, neuropeptides, proteases and a multitude of other mediators. For decades, pruritus treatment in children and adults with EB has been performed with established or ""historical"" therapies also used in the context of other chronic pruritic diseases such as atopic dermatitis or prurigo (e. g. topical glucocorticosteroids, emollients, sedating or non-sedating oral antihistamines, gabapentinoids). However, novel therapeutic agents have been repurposed for itch treatment in EB patients with chronic pruritus. Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor licensed for treatment of psoriasis, has recently been shown to alleviate inflammatory pruritus in generalized severe EB simplex. Moreover, a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody (Dupilumab) approved for subcutaneous treatment of atopic dermatitis, has successfully been used to reduce itch and prurigo-like skin lesions in dystrophic EB pruriginosa. Likewise, the oral Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist Serlopitant has been investigated in a first randomized trial revealing small, but clinically relevant effects on itch severity and a good safety profile in patients with dystrophic EB. Finally, the oral mu -opioid receptor antagonist Naltrexone, previously used off-label in cholestatic and uremic pruritus, has been reported to reduce pruritus and pruritic skin lesions in an adult with dystrophic EB pruriginosa. In summary, pruritus represents a still undertreated, yet highly significant complication in all EB subtypes. While established therapeutic strategies are known to have little impact on itch intensity and pruritic skin lesions, novel and promising therapeutic agents have been used in preliminary case studies or small clinical trials. Hence, further controlled investigations of these agents including sizeable patient numbers are urgently needed.",Ott H.,,1651-2057,/10.2340/00015555-3586,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.2340%2f00015555-3586,

"Key learnings and the informed design of a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study to evaluate the efficacy of tezepelumab in moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis",,"Background : Tezepelumab is a first- in- class human monoclonal antibody targeting thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial- derived cytokine implicated in atopic disease pathogenesis and believed to be an important target in atopic dermatitis (AD). The efficacy of TSLP blockade with tezepelumab in subjects with moderate- to- severe AD is currently under investigation in a phase 2b study (NCT03809663). A phase 2a adjunctive therapy study (ALLEVIAD) with tezepelumab failed to meet statistical significance (Simpson J Am Acad Dermatol 2019). The following key learnings from ALLEVIAD were used to inform the current phase 2b trial design. First, the ALLEVIAD study included an adjuvant run- in period using high- potency topical corticosteroids (TCS). Further, the patient population was not required to be refractory to TCS, which may have led to the increased placebo responses in ALLEVIAD and other studies, and there was an atypical skew of more moderate than severe AD subjects. The current phase 2b study focuses on tezepelumab as monotherapy, with revised inclusion criteria targeting chronic, treatment- refractory AD, to investigate the efficacy of tezepelumab in moderate- to- severe AD. Method : Eligible subjects (N~240) will include adults aged 18- 75 years with a diagnosis of chronic AD (>=2 years), an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score >= 3, an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score >= 16, and documented inadequate response to TCS treatment. After screening and documented discontinuation of topical AD therapy, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive tezepelumab (low, medium, and high dose) or placebo. The primary outcome is the efficacy of tezepelumab vs placebo at week 16, defined as an IGA score of 0/1 and 75% reduction in EASI (EASI 75). Secondary endpoints include EASI 50/90 and Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at week 16 and time to achieve EASI 50/75/90. An exploratory substudy (N~60) will evaluate tezepelumab combined with TCS as adjunctive therapy. Results : Study currently recruiting. Conclusion : This phase 2b study, which applies a monotherapy design to remove the confounders of adjuvant TCS and requires a minimum 2- year history of AD, higher EASI minimum score of 16, and TCS- refractory status at baseline, may enable more objective evaluation of clinical response. Given the chronic nature of AD, the longer treatment duration evaluation at week 16 (vs week 12 in ALLEVIAD) may reveal greater improvements in AD symptoms.",Komjathy S.; Griffiths J.; Parnes J.R.,,1398-9995,/10.1111/all.14506,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed21&DO=10.1111%2fall.14506,
"Signs, symptoms, and quality of life in atopic dermatitis: Early and sustained clinically meaningful responses with dupilumab and concomitant topical corticosteroids: A phase 3 trial post hoc analysis",,"Background: Dupilumab is approved for patients aged >= 12 years in the USA with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) inadequately controlled by topical prescription treatments or when those therapies are not advisable, adult AD patients in Japan not adequately controlled with existing therapies, and moderate to severe AD patients aged 18 years and older in Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy. This post hoc analysis describes the proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab plus concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) who achieved clinically meaningful responses in >= 1 of the 3 major AD domains (signs, symptoms, and quality of life [QoL]) using data from a long-term phase 3 trial (CHRONOS: NCT02260986). Method(s): Patients were randomized 3:1:3 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg plus concomitant TCS weekly (qw + TCS), every 2 weeks (q2w + TCS), or placebo + TCS for 52 weeks. Clinically meaningful responses were defined as: >= 50% reduction from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index score, or >= 3-point reduction from baseline in weekly average Peak daily Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score, or >= 4-point reduction from baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index score. Result(s): 315/106/319 patients were randomized to placebo + TCS/ q2w + TCS/qw + TCS. More patients achieved >= 1 clinically meaningful outcomes with dupilumab + TCS vs placebo + TCS as early as Week1 (qw + TCS/q2w + TCS vs. placebo + TCS: 62.7%/61.3% vs. 52.1%; P = 0.0067/P = 0.0972). At Week2, 80.6%/81.1% of patients in the qw + TCS/q2w + TCS groups reached >= 1 meaningful outcome vs. 60.3% of patients receiving placebo + TCS. These results were sustained or further improved at Week52 (qw + TCS/q2w + TCS vs. placebo + TCS: 72.1%/79.2% vs. 36.2%) (P < 0.0001 for all timepoints Week2-Week52). Injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis were more frequent with dupilumab than placebo. Conclusion(s): In this long-term phase 3 trial, a higher proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with dupilumab + TCS had clinically meaningful improvement in 1 or more key AD domains (signs, symptoms, and QoL) as early as Week1 and through Week52.

407 High burden of patient-reported ocular disorders and symptoms in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis,,"Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have a higher risk of conjunctivitis and other ocular surface disorders than the general population, and the incidence of ocular complications increases with AD severity. Here, we report the burden of ocular disorders and symptoms prior to treatment initiation in adults with moderate-to-severe AD with inadequate response to topical corticosteroids enrolled in LIBERTY AD CHRONOS (NCT02260986), a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of dupilumab. CHRONOS enrolled 740 patients after a 35-day screening period. Patients completed a survey of ocular disorders in the past year at screening, and ocular symptoms (itching, tearing, redness, and discomfort) in the past month at baseline. Among the 712 patients who responded to the survey at screening, the number (%) of patients who reported having diagnoses of ocular disorders in the previous year were as follows: atopic keratoconjunctivitis, 87 (12.2); keratoconus, 15 (2.1); perennial allergic conjunctivitis, 107 (15.0); dry eye, 146 (20.5); herpes simplex virus infection of the eye, 30 (4.2); and rosacea of the eye, 19 (2.7). At baseline, approximately 46-63% of all patients reported having >= 1 ocular symptom (itching, tearing, redness, or discomfort) from some of the time to all of the time in the past month; approximately 25-32% reported these symptoms as being mild, 12-22% reported them as being moderate, and 4-7% reported them as being severe.

"Tralokinumab, an anti-interleukin-13 monoclonal antibody, reduces Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the skin and systemic levels of inflammatory biomarkers in atopic dermatitis patients",,"Interleukin (IL)-13 plays an important role in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that potently and specifically neutralizes IL-13. In this phase 2b study (NCT02347176), 204 adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous tralokinumab 45 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg, or placebo, every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Concomitant Class 3 (World Health Organization) topical corticosteroids were administered at least once daily during a 2-week run-in and as needed throughout the treatment and follow-up periods. Clinical efficacy was evaluated as change from baseline in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) and proportion of participants with Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 at week 12. Exploratory measurements included changes of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) abundance, assessed by skin swabs, and serum biomarkers, including chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), periostin, and immunoglobulin E (IgE), from baseline to week 12. SA abundance and serum levels of CCL17 both correlated with disease severity (EASI) at baseline. At week 12, tralokinumab 300 mg significantly improved change from baseline in EASI versus placebo (-4.9; P = .01) and a greater percentage of participants achieved an IGA response (26.7% vs. 11.8%). Tralokinumab (300 mg) versus placebo reduced the levels of CCL17 (-40.0% vs. +37.4%), periostin (-31.3% vs. +2.0%), and IgE (-22.3% vs. +1.7%). DDP-4 levels were only minimally affected by treatment (+7.3% vs. +3.9%). A markedly higher proportion of patients treated with tralokinumab 300 mg were SA-negative at week 12 (61.5%) compared with placebo-treated patients (23.5%). Upper respiratory tract infection was the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event reported as related to the study drug in both the placebo (3.9%) and pooled tralokinumab groups (3.9%). Tralokinumab treatment led to a clear improvement in the clinical symptoms of AD as well as to reductions in SA abundance and levels of AD-associated serum biomarkers periostin, CCL17, and IgE, while DPP-4 was increased to levels similar to placebo.",Guttman-Yassky E.; Silverberg J.; Roepke M.; Wollenberg A.,,0190-9622,/10.1016/j.jaad.2019.06.522,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaad.2019.06.522,
Treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis with dupilumab in real clinical practice. Baseline characteristics of patients from 5 reference dermatology units included in the dupilumab expanded access in Spain,,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory and pruritic skin disease, with a prevalence of 1-3% of the adult population. Usually begins in early childhood, progresses with a recurrent course before disappearing at puberty, and may persist to adulthood or present de novo during this period. It is frequently associated with elevated levels of serum IgE, individual or family history of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis and asthma. The therapeutic approach in adult AD patients can be frankly complicated beyond topical treatments, as phototherapy and/or systemic therapies often do not guarantee adequate control of the disease. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4 Ralpha), blocking both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, inhibiting the entire TH2 pathway. It is the first targeted therapy approved by the FDA for and EMA for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults, based on two randomized phase III trials, and its extended use has recently begun in our country. Method(s): We present the baseline characteristics of a series of 27 patients with moderate to severe AD from 5 Andalusian hospitals to whom dupilumab has been prescribed in the context of the compassionate use program in Spain. The data collected in this included age, time of evolution, personal history (comorbidities) and previous systemic/biological treatments and disease severity parameters at baseline visit. Result(s): The mean age of our series was 42,11 (19-64) years old. 70.37% of the patients were male. The median time of evolution of the disease was 25.7 (3-44) years. Concomitant atopic diseases were present in the following proportions: nasal polyps 14.81%, conjunctivitis 33.38%, asthma 37.03%, allergic rhinitis 55.55%, alimentary allergies 22.22%. The patients had received previous systemic corticosteroids in the 100% of the cases, while 96.29% received cyclosporine, 40.74% phototherapy, 37.03% methotrexate, 44.44% azathioprine, 14.80% mofetil mycophenolate, and 29.62% IV immunoglobulin previously. The mean baseline SCORAD was 59, and the pruritus VAS was 8.3. The patients included in the Spanish AD Dupilumab compassionate use program had an important baseline severity, along with several comorbid atopic conditions. They had a clinical history of multiple treatment failures before being included in this program.",Pereyra-Rodriguez J.J.; Alcantara-Luna S.; Armario-Hita J.C.; Dominguez-Cruz J.; Martinez-Pilar L.; Ruiz-Villaverde R.,,0190-9622,/10.1016/j.jaad.2019.06.1249,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaad.2019.06.1249,
"Tralokinumab significantly reduces Staphylococcus aureus colonization in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Results from a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study",,"Background/Objective: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory dermatological disorder with a high disease burden. The pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial, involving a cycle of itching, scratching, skin barrier dysfunction, microbial abnormalities and immune-mediated inflammation that is characterized by increased levels of Type 2 cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-13. AD is associated with increased Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization. S. aureus might amplify cutaneous inflammatory responses via the release of superantigens, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 and the staphylococcal enterotoxins, which can cause excessive production of T-cell cytokines and toxins (such as alpha-toxin) that can damage keratinocytes, intensifying symptoms and resulting in disease flares. Tralokinumab is an IgG4 fully human monoclonal antibody that works by specifically blocking the effects of IL-13 and has been evaluated in a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02347176) in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Results of the study showed improvements in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scores with tralokinumab on a background of topical corticosteroids (TCS), with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of tralokinumab treatment on S. aureus colonization in patients with moderate-to-severe AD participating in the Phase IIb study. Method(s): Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous tralokinumab (45mg, 150mg or 300mg) or placebo every two weeks for 12 weeks on a background of TCS. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years with physician-confirmed diagnosis of AD for at least one year (according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria) and with AD body surface area involvement of 10 percent or greater, EASI score of 12 or greater, SCORAD of 25 or greater, and IGA of 3 or greater. Concomitant Class 3 (World Health Organization) TCS were administered at least once daily during the two-week run-in and as needed throughout the treatment and follow-up periods. Result(s): Overall, 204 patients were randomized in the Phase IIb study (placebo, n=51; tralokinumab 45mg, n=50; tralokinumab 150mg, n=51; tralokinumab 300mg, n=52) and included in the intent-to-treat population. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar between treatment groups. In lesional skin at baseline, the number of S. aureus-positive patients was similar across treatment groups (placebo, n=38 [74.5%]; tralokinumab 45mg, n=34 [68.0%]; tralokinumab 150mg, n=37 [74.0%]; tralokinumab 300mg, n=35 [67.3%]). In nonlesional skin at baseline, the number of S. aureuspositive patients was lower compared to lesional skin and varied more across the treatment groups (placebo, n=21 [41.2%]; tralokinumab 45mg, n=16 [32.0%]; tralokinumab 150mg, n=26 [52.0%]; tralokinumab 300mg, n=17 [32.7%]). There was a significant difference in the percentage of S. aureus-positive patients at Week 12 compared to placebo for all three tralokinumab dose groups in both lesional and nonlesional skin, with the greatest differences observed for the tralokinumab 300mg group. The number of patients excluded from the analysis due to the use of prohibited medication was placebo, n=3 (5.9%); tralokinumab 45mg, n=6 (12.0%); tralokinumab 150 mg n=4 (7.8%); tralokinumab 300mg, n=0. The percentage of patients with a shift from S. aureus-positive at baseline to S. aureus-negative at Week 12 was higher, and S. aureus-negative at baseline to S. aureus-positive at Week 12 was lower, in all tralokinumab dose groups compared to placebo in both lesional and nonlesional skin. In lesional skin, the greatest shift in patients from S. aureus-positive to S. aureus-negative was observed for the tralokinumab 300mg group, while in nonlesional skin, the effect was greatest for the tralokinumab 150mg group. Conclusion(s): Treatment with tralokinumab on a background of TCS led to significant reductions in S. aureus colonization compared to placebo in both lesional and nonlesional skin of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The results of this study suggest that, in addition to improving disease severity scores, specific neutralization of IL-13 with tralokinumab reduces S. aureus colonization, potentially leading to fewer skin infections and AD flares. The effect of tralokinumab 300mg on the reduction of S. aureus colonization will be further examined in a large Phase III study in adults with moderate-to-severe AD.",Guttman-Yassky E.; Silverberg J.I.; Fensholdt J.; Lindegaard K.K.; Wollenberg A.,,1941-2789,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&AN=629676602,
"Primary results from a Phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of upadacitinib for patients with atopic dermatitis",,"Background/Objective: Prednisone is the only United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral systemic treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). A large unmet need exists for oral treatments with higher efficacy and suitable long-term safety. Upadacitinib (UPA), a once-a-day, oral, JAK1- selective inhibitor, is currently being investigated for several inflammatory diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of multiple doses of UPA monotherapy versus placebo for treatment of moderate-tosevere adult AD. Method(s): Included participants were adults aged 18 to 75 years with dermatologist-confirmed AD whose symptoms onset at least one year pre-baseline. Included participants had a documented history of inadequate response to topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) or for whom topical treatments were medically inadvisable. In addition, patients were required to have moderate-tosevere AD at baseline, with an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score of at least 16, a body surface area (BSA) of at least 10 percent, and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3. Exclusion criteria were treatment with TCSs, TCIs, or prescription moisturizers with additives within 10 days before baseline, as well as prior exposure to dupilumab or systemic JAK inhibitors. Period 1 of the study was a 16-week, double-blind monotherapy where patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either UPA 30mg QD (n=42), UPA 15mg once daily (QD) (n=42), UPA 7.5mg QD (n=42), or placebo (n=41). In Period 2, each of these four groups were randomized 1:1 in a 72-week, blinded extension to UPA 30mg QD, UPA 15mg QD, UPA 7.5mg QD, and UPA 30mg, respectively. The primary endpoint was mean percent improvement from baseline in EASI score at Week 16. Result(s): At Week 16, the subgroup receiving UPA 30mg experienced the highest mean percent improvement from baseline in EASI score and pruritis, peaking at 82.7 percent and ending at 74.4 percent by Week 16. At Week 16, UPA 30mg was 61.7 percent, UPA 7.5mg was 39.4 percent, and placebo was 23.0 percent. The UPA 30mg group also achieved the best results for EASI-50, EASI-75, EASI-90, and IGA 0/1. Serious (n=4) and severe (n=2) adverse events (AEs) were rare. Common treatment-related adverse events included upper respiratory tract infection, worsening of AD, and acne. Conclusion(s): UPA met all primary and secondary efficiency endpoints in AD. No herpes zoster, malignancies, deaths, or cases of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis were reported. The emerging positive benefit/risk profile observed for UPA in AD resulted in FDA breakthrough designation and supports proceeding with Phase III trials in AD.",Guttman-Yassky E.; Pangan A.L.; Silverberg J.I.; Thaci D.; Hong C.H.; Mohamed M.E.F.; Othman A.A.; Gu Y.; Anderson J.K.; Teixeira H.D.,,1941-2789,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&AN=629676599,
Single-dose Phase 2a trial of etokimab (anti-IL-33) in severe eosinophilic asthma,,"Background : Etokimab is an anti-human interleukin-33 (IL-33) monoclonal antibody developed for the treatment of atopic diseases and severe asthma. Previous trials have demonstrated etokimab ' s efficacy and safety in the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and severe peanut allergy. Method : In this Phase 2a trial, 25 adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, with equal or greater than 300 blood eosinophils per microliter, were randomized to receive 300 mg of etokimab or placebo while continuing on background inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonist therapy. FEV1, blood eosinophil count and safety were assessed at intervals for 127 days post dosing. Results : In patients dosed with etokimab (n = 12) FEV1 improved relative to placebo (n = 13) by 8% at day 2, 11% at day 64 and 6% at day 127. Blood eosinophil level decrease mirrored FEV1 improvement, with a maximum reduction of 46% at Day 64 in etokimab dosed patients over placebo, which decreased to 8% over placebo by day 127. No SAEs were reported and AEs were similarly distributed between placebo (38%) and etokimab (50%) dosed patients. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were single occurrences of moderate strep throat in two etokimab dosed patients and single occurrences of vomiting in two placebo-dosed patients. Exacerbation events were observed post-Day 64 in two placebo dosed patients and one etokimab dosed patient. Conclusion : These results are the first reported evidence indicating that IL-33 inhibition modulates severe eosinophilic asthma and support the advancement of etokimab for this indication.",Londei M.; Marquette-Hamoudi A.; Phenis K.; Pinkstaff J.; Sacco N.; Pavord I.D.,,1398-9995,/10.1111/all.13958,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1111%2fall.13958,
102 Dupilumab Decreases Staphylococcus aureus Colonization and Increases Microbial Diversity in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) colonization. Dupilumab (DPL), an anti-IL-4Ralpha mAb that inhibits signaling of IL-4/IL-13, key drivers of Type 2/Th2 inflammation, is approved for patients aged >=12 years in the USA with moderate-to-severe AD inadequately controlled by topical prescription treatments or when those therapies are not advisable, adult AD patients in Japan not adequately controlled with existing therapies, and adults with moderate-to-severe AD in Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy. We investigated DPL treatment in AD influences skin colonization by SA and skin microbiome diversity. In a phase 2 trial (NCT01979016), 54 adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized (1:1) to weekly subcutaneous injections with DPL 200mg or placebo (PBO) for 16 weeks. SA absolute abundance was assessed by qPCR and relative microbial composition by 16S rRNA sequencing. AD severity was assessed by the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Serum biomarkers (CCL17, CCL18, and IgE) were measured. At baseline, SA had higher absolute abundance on lesional vs non-lesional skin (P<0.05). Lesional skin showed a distinct cluster in microbial beta-diversity (P<0.001) and lower alpha-diversity (P<0.05). DPL decreased SA absolute and relative abundance while overall microbial diversity increased. DPL improved EASI scores and decreased serum biomarkers. No major changes were noted with PBO. Improved EASI and serum biomarkers strongly correlated with decreased SA abundance (P<0.001). These results reveal strong links between SA, the skin microbial community, serum biomarkers, and AD severity, and demonstrate that targeted suppression of Type 2 immunity by anti-IL-4Ralpha mAb improves the skin microbial community.Copyright © 2019",Callewaert C.; Knight R.; Nakatsuji T.; Hamilton J.D.; Guttman-Yassky E.; Bissonnette R.; Silverberg J.; Krueger J.; Gallo R.,,0022-202X,/10.1016/j.jid.2019.07.106,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.jid.2019.07.106,
162 Biomarkers CCL17/TARC and Total IgE Do Not Predict Clinical Response to Dupilumab in Atopic Dermatitis (AD): a Post hoc Analysis of Pooled Phase 3 Data (SOLO 1 & 2),,"Dupilumab (DUP), a fully human IL-4Ralpha mAb, inhibits signaling of IL-4/IL-13, key drivers of Type 2/Th2 immune diseases such as AD/asthma. CCL17 (TARC) and IgE production are enhanced by IL-4/IL-13 and correlate with AD severity. This pooled post hoc analysis reports the relationship between baseline (BL) serum CCL17 and total IgE levels and DUP treatment effect in adults with moderate-to-severe AD in 2 identical double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 3 trials (SOLO 1: NCT02277743, N=671; SOLO 2: NCT02277769, N=708). Patients (pts; N=1,379) were randomized (1:1:1) to subcutaneous 300 mg DUP weekly (qw), every 2 weeks (q2w), or PBO for 16 weeks (W). CCL17 and total IgE were measured in serum samples collected between BL and W16 using commercial assays. Efficacy analyses by BL CCL17 tertiles (<=1115; >1115 to <=4300; and >4300 pg/mL) and total IgE subgroups (<150 kU/L and >=150 kU/L) were performed for % changes from BL in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and peak pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). On study entry, pts with low BL CCL17 (<=1115 pg/mL; n=457) or IgE concentrations (<150 kU/L; n=220) had numerically lower BL EASI and pruritus NRS scores than pts with high CCL17 (>4300 pg/mL; n=457) or IgE levels (>=150 kU/L; n=1158). Both DUP dose regimens significantly reduced EASI and pruritus NRS scores from BL at W16 vs PBO in pts with high, mid, or low BL CCL17 or high or low IgE levels (all P<0.0001 vs PBO, except pruritus in the low IgE group [P=0.002/P=0.006; qw/q2w]). The most common adverse events with DUP vs PBO were injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis. BL levels of CCL17 and IgE did not predict DUP treatment response (% reductions in EASI and pruritus NRS), although the smaller n of the low IgE group and lower BL disease activity in the low CCL17 and IgE groups may affect the power of this analysis.Copyright © 2019",Hamilton J.D.; Chen Z.; Simpson E.L.; Graham N.M.; Clibborn C.; Sorrentino A.; Ardeleanu M.,,0022-202X,/10.1016/j.jid.2019.07.166,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1016%2fj.jid.2019.07.166,
Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and a history of nonsteroidal immunosuppressant use: A post hoc analysis of the phase III CAFE trial,,"Dupilumab, a fully human VelocImmune-derived monoclonal antibody against interleukin (IL)-4 receptor-a, inhibits signalling of IL-4 and IL-13, type 2/T helper 2 cytokines involved in atopic and allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD). It is approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD and, in the U.S.A., adults with moderate-to-severe asthma. In the phase 3 LIBERTY AD CAFE trial (NCT02755649), dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) significantly improved signs and symptoms of AD and quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile, in adults with a history of inadequate response to or intolerance of ciclosporin A. Here, we analyse the effect of dupilumab vs. placebo in patients who had previously used any nonsteroidal systemic immunosuppressants and were enrolled in the CAFE trial. CAFE was a multinational, multicentre, double-blind, phase III, placebo-controlled trial. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD (n = 325) were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to 16 weeks of subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg with concomitant corticosteroids (TCS) every week (qw+TCS), every 2 weeks (q2w+TCS) or placebo + TCS. The outcomes presented here are the proportions of patients with at least 75% or 50% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 75 and EASI 50) and safety. Patients were considered nonresponders after first rescue use. Of all randomized patients, 227 had received prior nonsteroidal immunosuppressants (placebo+TCS n = 73, q2w+TCS n = 76, qw+TCS n = 78); 210 patients received ciclosporin, 30 methotrexate, 26 azathioprine and 16 mycophenolate mofetil. The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. Higher proportions of patients receiving either dupilumab regimen achieved EASI 75 at week 8 compared with placebo+TCS (21.9% placebo+TCS, 50.0% q2w+TCS; P < 0.001 vs. placebo+TCS, 51.3% qw+TCS; P < 0.001 vs. placebo+TCS), increasing to week 16 (26.0% placebo+ TCS, 59.2% q2w+TCS, 57.7% qw+TCS; P < 0.001 vs. placebo+ TCS both regimens). Similarly, higher proportions of patients receiving dupilumab compared with placebo+TCS achieved EASI 50 by week 8 (34.2% placebo+TCS, 73.7% q2w+TCS, 78.2% qw+TCS; P < 0.001 vs. placebo+TCS both regimens), with proportions increasing to week 16 (38.4% placebo+TCS, 81.6% q2w+TCS, 83.3% qw+TCS; P < 0.001 vs. placebo+TCS both regimens). Overall rates of adverse events were similar in the three treatment groups. In the CAFE trial, more than 70% of dupilumab- treated patients previously treated with nonsteroidal immunosuppressants achieved EASI 50 at week 8, and more than 80% achieved EASI 50 at week 16. These results demonstrate that dupilumab is efficacious in this population of patients with more severe disease, with acceptable safety.",Bouaziz J.-D.; Ogg G.; De Bruin-Weller M.; Bieber T.; Irvine A.; Shumel B.; Msihid J.; Rossi A.B.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.17752,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed20&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.17752,
Long-term management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with dupilumab and concomitant topical corticosteroids (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS): a critical appraisal,,"Aim: Blauvelt et al. aimed to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab with medium-potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) vs. placebo with TCS in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Setting and design: This multicentre randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in hospitals, clinics and academic institutions across 161 sites in 14 countries. Study exposure: Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned (3: 1: 3) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg once weekly plus TCS, dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks plus TCS or placebo plus TCS until week 52. Outcome(s): Co-primary efficacy end points were percentage of patients achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and 2 points or higher improvement from baseline, and Eczema Area and Severity Index 75% improvement from baseline (EASI-75) at week 16. Result(s): In total, 740 patients were included in the trial: 319 were randomly assigned to dupilumab once weekly, 106 to dupilumab every 2 weeks and 315 to the placebo arm. At week 16, more patients in the dupilumab groups achieved the co-primary end points: IGA 0/1 [39% (n = 125) once-weekly dosing, 39% (n = 41) every 2 weeks dosing vs. 12% (n = 39) receiving placebo; P < 0.0001] and EASI-75 [64% (n = 204) and 69% (n = 73) vs. 23% (n = 73); P < 0.0001]. While no new safety signals were identified, adverse effects were noted in 261 (83%) of those receiving dupilumab once weekly plus TCS, 97 (88%) receiving dupilumab every 2 weeks plus TCS and 266 (84%) for those receiving placebo plus TCS. Rates of conjunctivitis, injection site reactions and local herpes simplex infections were higher in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group. Conclusion(s): Blauvelt et al. concluded that dupilumab treatment added to TCS improved AD up to week 52 vs. TCS alone, and also demonstrated acceptable safety.Copyright © 2018 British Association of Dermatologists",Thomson J.; Wernham A.G.H.; Williams H.C.,,0007-0963,/10.1111/bjd.16317,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.16317,
DUPILUMAB IMPROVES ABSENTEEISM IN MODERATE-TO-SEVERE ATOPIC DERMATITIS PATIENTS COMPARED WITH PLACEBO IN PHASE 3 LIBERTY AD SOLO STUDIES,,"Objectives: To assess absenteeism from work/school in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) using 2 identical, pooled, phase 3, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (SOLO 1:NCT02277743; SOLO 2:NCT02277769). Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin (IL)-4Ralpha monoclonal antibody that inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13 (key drivers of Type 2-mediated inflammation), is approved in the EU and USA for adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): Patients aged >=18 years with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized to placebo/dupilumab 300mg every-2-weeks (q2w)/300mg weekly (qw). The duration-adjusted annualized absenteeism rate (days missed from work or school) at Week 16 was estimated post hoc using Poisson regression: treatment, region, and baseline Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) strata were fixed factors. Result(s): Dupilumab-treated patients in full-time work/school had significantly lower losses in productivity vs placebo-treated patients. The annualized absenteeism rates (in days) per patient-year in SOLO 1&2 were 9.10 (n=319) vs 3.51 (n=332)/4.72 (n=346) for placebo vs dupilumab q2w/qw (P<0.0001). Similar results were observed across subgroups defined by baseline disease severity, with a trend for greater effect of dupilumab in higher baseline severity subgroups: 1) IGA=4 (placebo: 11.29 days [n=146]; dupilumab q2w: 3.18 days [n=158]; dupilumab qw: 5.70 days [n=166]; P<0.0001 vs placebo) vs IGA=3 (6.42 [n=173]; 3.52 [n=174]; 3.60 [n=180] respectively; P<0.0001 vs placebo); 2) baseline Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)>=7 (placebo: 10.98 [n=219]; dupilumab q2w: 4.78 [n=219]; dupilumab qw: 5.68 [n=230]; P<0.0001 vs placebo) vs Peak Pruritus NRS<7 (5.05 [n=100]; 1.28 [n=112]; 3.17 [n=114] respectively; P<0.001 vs placebo), and 3) Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)>10 (placebo: 12.95 [n=207]; dupilumab q2w: 4.97 [n=224]; dupilumab qw: 6.53 [n=235]; P<0.0001 vs placebo) vs DLQI<=10 (1.73 [n=112]; 0.57 [n=108]; 0.87 [n=111], respectively; P<0.01 vs placebo).

The effect of dose regimen adjustment on maintenance of clinical response and safety of dupilumab in patients with atopic dermatitis (liberty ad solo-continue),,"Background: Dupilumab (anti-IL-4Ralpha) is approved for treatment of adults with inadequately-controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In two phase 3 studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 [SOLO]), dupilumab for 16 weeks (wks) significantly improved AD signs/symptoms. SOLO-CONTINUE (NCT02395133; CONTINUE) evaluated response maintenance and long-term safety of multiple dose regimens of dupilumab vs placebo (PBO) in a subgroup of SOLO patients (pts). Method(s): In this randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled trial, pts treated with dupilumab 300 mg every two wks (q2w) or wkly (qw) who achieved IGA 0/1 or EASI-75 status at Wk16 in SOLO were re-randomized (2:1:1:1) to continue dupilumab monotherapy at the original q2w/qw regimens, or every 4 weeks (q4w), 8 weeks (q8w), or PBO for 36 weeks. Result(s): 422 of 919 SOLO pts were re-randomized. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. Pts continuing q2w/qw showed the best maintenance of efficacy, with nearly no difference between CONTINUE baseline (Wk0) and Wk36 in percent change in EASI from SOLO baseline (co-primary) whereas q4w/q8w/PBO showed dose-dependent reductions in response (difference, Wk36-Wk0: [q2w/qw]/q4w/q8w/PBO: 0.06%/3.84%/6.84%/21.67%; P < 0.0001, q2w/qw vs PBO; nominal P = 0.1980, q2w/qw vs q4w; nominal P = 0.0247, q2w/qw vs q8w). Pruritus NRS showed similar results (q2w/qw,-0.1%, P < 0.0001 vs PBO; q4w/q8w/PBO, 8.6%/16.7%/35.6%). Among pts with EASI-75 at Wk0, more q2w/qw pts maintained EASI-75 at Wk36 (co-primary) than q4w/q8w/PBO pts (71.6%/58.3%/54.9%/30.4%; P < 0.0001, q2w/qw vs PBO; nominal P = 0.0450 vs q4w; nominal P = 0.0104 vs q8w). The q2w/qw regimens showed significant efficacy vs PBO and were numerically superior vs q4w and q8w in other outcomes, eg, fewer flares and higher proportion of pts reporting no pain/discomfort. Q2w and qw had similar maintenance of response. Lower incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TE-ADA) was observed in pts who maintained the q2w/qw regimens (4.3%/1.2%) vs q4w/q8w/PBO (6.0%/11.7%/11.3%). In pts who developed TE-ADAs, no meaningful impact on safety, efficacy, or PK was observed. No new safety signals were identified. There were fewer skin infections in q2w/qw than q4w/q8w/PBO. Treatment groups had similar conjunctivitis rates ([q2w/qw]/q4w/q8w/PBO: 5.4%/4.6%/3.6%/4.9%).

Dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis by history of asthma and allergic rhinitis: Analysis from a 52 week randomized phase 3 trial (liberty ad chronos),,"Background: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against interleukin (IL)-4 receptor-a, inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, type 2/Th2 cytokines involved in atopic/allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis (AR). This post hoc subgroup analysis was intended to determine if a history of asthma or AR impacts the efficacy of dupilumab treatment for AD in the long-term phase 3 CHRONOS trial (NCT02260986). Dupilumab is approved in the EU, USA, and other countries for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): Adult patients (pts) were randomized 3:1:3 to dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw): every 2 weeks (q2w): placebo (PBO) for 52 weeks with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. End-points included proportion of pts with Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and >=2-point improvement from baseline (primary), and a >= 75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75). Result(s): Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment arms in each of the subgroups; with a history of asthma: PBO (n = 162), q2w (n = 51), and qw (n = 151); and without asthma history: PBO (n = 153), q2w (n = 55), and qw (n = 168); with a history of AR: PBO (n = 142), q2w (n = 54), and qw (n = 142), and without AR history: PBO (n = 173), q2w (n = 52), and qw (n = 177). At Week 52 more pts receiving dupilumab q2w or qw achieved an IGA 0/1 and >=2-point improvement vs PBO regardless of asthma comorbidity; with asthma: 32.6%/36.4% vs 12.1% (q2w/qw vs placebo; P = 0.0008/P < 0.0001); without asthma: 39.5%/43.5% vs 12.9% (P = 0.0001/P < 0.0001). Similar results were observed for pts with AR comorbidity; with AR: 31.8%/45.3% vs 16.1% (P = 0.0723/P < 0.0001); without AR: 40.0%/35.9% vs 9.9% (P = 0.0001 both). Additionally, more pts receiving dupilumab achieved EASI-75 vs PBO regardless of asthma comorbidity; with asthma: 65.2%/63.6% vs 20.7%; without asthma: 65.1%/64.5% vs 22.6%. Similar results were observed for pts with AR comorbidity; with AR: 65.9%/71.8% vs 25.0%; without AR: 64.4%/58.2% vs 19.1% (P < 0.0001 for all AR comparisons). The most common adverse events (>=10%) attributable to dupilumab were injection site reactions and conjunctivitis.

"Safety of dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Clinical laboratory results from three phase 3 clinical trials (LIBERTY AD: SOLO 1, SOLO 2 and CHRONOS)",,"Background: Dupilumab (anti-interleukin-4-receptor-alpha mAb) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adults with mod-erate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Previous phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of 16/52 weeks (weeks) treatment with dupilumab in AD. We report clinical laboratory data from SOLO1&2 and CHRONOS. Method(s): SOLO1&2 (16 weeks) and CHRONOS (52 weeks) were 3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 3 trials. Patients (pts) were randomized 1:1:1 (SOLOs) or 3:1:3 (CHRONOS) to dupilumab qw, q2w, or PBO. Pts in CHRONOS received a standardized regimen of concomitant topical corticosteroids that could be tapered/stopped based on response. Result(s): Clinical laboratory data were assessed in 1376 pts from SOLOs and in 740 pts from CHRONOS. Baseline (BL) characteristics were balanced across treatment groups. Hematology and serum chemistry values were generally consistent with BL data. Dupilumab-treated pts had greater mean initial increase from BL in eosinophils (eos) vs the PBO group in SOLOs, with the highest increase observed at Wk4 (0.10/0.09/-0.01 x109/L [qw/q2w/PBO]). Eos returned to near BL levels by Wk16. The increase in eos was not seen in CHRONOS. The incidence of treatment-emergent (TE) eosi-nophilia (>=500 cells/mcL) was similar for dupilumab and PBO in all 3 trials. Marked TE eosinophilia (>=5000 cells/mcL) was reported in <1% of dupilumab-treated pts and none in PBO-treated pts. There were no adverse events associated with eosinophilia. In most cases eos returned to near BL levels during study treatment. A greater mean decrease in lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) from BL through Wk16/Wk52 was observed in dupilumab-vs PBO-treated pts (SOLOs Wk16:-76.0/-69.7/-26.2; CHRONOS Wk52:-79.5/-89.8/-45.9 IU/L [qw/q2w/PBO]). With exception of BL values in CHRONOS, mean LDH values for each treatment group were within the normal range throughout the study period. No clinically meaningful changes between the treatment groups were observed for other hematological, chemistry or urinalysis parameters; vital signs; electro-cardiogram and physical examination parameters. Conclusion(s): There were no untoward clinically important changes in laboratory parameters that could be attributed to the study treat-ment.

Dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and comorbid asthma requiring treatment: Analysis from two pooled phase 3 trials (liberty ad solo 1&2),,"Background: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against IL-4Ra, inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, type 2/Th2 cytoki-nes involved in atopic/allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, and allergic rhinitis which often associate as comor-bidities. This post hoc subgroup analysis examined if concurrent active asthma requiring treatment impacted the efficacy of dupilu-mab treatment for AD in two pooled phase 3 monotherapy trials (SOLO 1: NCT02277743; SOLO 2: NCT02277769). We also examined if dupilumab improved asthma control in AD patients (pts) with concurrent active asthma. Dupilumab is approved in the EU, USA, and other countries for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): Adult pts with moderate to severe AD whose disease is inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable were randomized 1:1:1 to dupilu-mab 300 mg weekly (qw): every 2 weeks (q2w): placebo (PBO) for 16 weeks. Endpoints included proportion of pts with both Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and >=2-point improvement from baseline, >=75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75), and >=4-point improvement in peak pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS). Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) outcomes were assessed in pts with active asthma. Result(s): The proportion of AD pts with concurrent active asthma requiring treatment was generally balanced across treatment groups (28.0%/29.5%/25.5%; PBO/q2w/qw), and had slightly more severe AD than pts without concurrent asthma. At Wk 16 more pts receiving dupilumab q2w or qw achieved an IGA 0/1 and >=2 point improvement vs PBO regardless of concurrent asthma (31.9%/32.2% vs 10.9%; q2w/qw vs PBO) or without (39.1%/38.4% vs 8.8%).

Analysis of the long-term consistency of clinical response with dupilumab plus concomitant topical corticosteroids,,"Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor a monoclonal antibody, is approved in the USA, European Union and other countries for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Commonly, AD signs and symptoms have a chronic relapsing course, which limits the utility of single-time-point analyses. We report the consistency of response over time using repeated measures from a 52-week phase III trial of dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients with AD (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS: NCT02260986). This double-blinded, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe AD inadequately controlled with topical medication. Patients were randomized to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or PBO every week, and applied medium-potency TCS daily on active lesions. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were recorded between week 16 and 52 every 4 weeks (10 time points); end points included the proportions of patients with > 50% and > 75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index, and > 3-point improvement in peak pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS). We defined consistent response as achieving the response threshold most of the time (at least six of the 10 time points). Safety was also assessed. In total 106 patients received dupilumab 300 mg q2w + TCS, and 315 patients received PBO + TCS. For EASI 50, consistent response was reported in 33.3% of patients receiving PBO + TCS vs. 78.3% of patients receiving dupilumab + TCS (P < 0.001). For EASI 75, consistent response was reported in 22.9% of patients receiving PBO + TCS vs. 67.9% of patients receiving dupilu-mab + TCS (P < 0.001). For > 3-point improvement in peak pruritus NRS, consistent response was reported in 17.1% of patients receiving PBO + TCS vs. 65.1% of patients receiving dupilumab + TCS (P < 0.001). When examining EASI and NRS as continuous assessment the sustained nature of the treatment response was also demonstrated by a least-squares mean percentage change (+/- SE) in EASI of -60.9 +/- 4.29 and -84.9 +/- 6.73 (P < 0.001), and a least-squares mean percentage change (+/- SE) in NRS of -31.7 +/- 3.95 and -57.0 +/- 6.17 (P < 0.001) for the PBO and dupilumab arms, respectively, from baseline to week 52. Overall, treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates were similar in all treatment groups. Commonly occurring TEAEs attributable to dupilumab were injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis. These repeat-measure responder analyses provide an assessment of patient-level response consistency over 52 weeks, supplementing the continuous end point analyses. Compared with PBO + TCS, dupilumab + TCS results in higher rates of responders, and the response is also more consistent and better sustained over time.",De Bruin-Weller M.; Blauvelt A.; Simpson E.; Chen Z.; Lu Y.; Akinlade B.; Gadkari A.; Eckert L.; Shumel B.; Rossi A.; Ardeleanu M.,,1365-2133,/10.1111/bjd.16718,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed19&DO=10.1111%2fbjd.16718,
Dupilumab improves atopic dermatitis equally well in all anatomical regions: Data from the LIBERTY phase III clinical trials,,"Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ra) that inhibits signalling of IL-4 and IL-13, which are key drivers of type 2/ Th2-mediated inflammation. Dupilumab is approved in the EU, U.S.A., and other countries for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In phase III clinical trials, dupilumab improved the signs and symptoms of AD and had an acceptable safety profile. In four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trials, patients with moderate-to-severe AD were given placebo weekly (qw), dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or dupilumab 300 mg qw for either 16 weeks (SOLO 1, NCT02277743; SOLO 2, NCT02277769; CAFE, NCT02755649) or 52 weeks (CHRONOS, NCT02260986). In the CHRONOS and CAFE studies, patients were administered concomitant topical corticosteroids. Patients in the CAFE study had severe AD not adequately controlled with, intolerant to, or otherwise medically inadvisable for oral cyclosporine. In this analysis, data from SOLO 1 & 2 were pooled. It has been previously reported that the effectiveness of certain AD treatments is disproportionate in different anatomical regions. This post hoc analysis evaluates differential efficacy of dupilumab by anatomical region in four clinical trials, using least-squares (LS) mean percentage change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) by region: head and neck (H), upper extremities (U), trunk (T) and lower extremities (L). In all four trials, dupilumab-treated patients had significantly greater LS mean percentage change (i.e. reduction, reflecting improvement) from baseline at Week 16 in EASI in everybody region (dupilumab q2w/qw vs. placebo [P < 0.0001]).

"Dupilumab leads to no or low disease activity in most moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients: Signs, symptoms and quality of life",,"Dupilumab, a fully human interleukin (IL)-4Ra monoclonal antibody, inhibits signalling of IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2/Th2-mediated inflammation. Dupilumab is approved in the EU, U.S.A., and other countries for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). In phase III clinical trials SOLO 1 & 2 and CHRONOS (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1, LIBERTY AD SOLO 2, and LIBERTY AD CHRONOS), dupilumab improved signs and symptoms of AD, with an acceptable safety profile. This post hoc analysis aims to examine objective and subjective treatment outcomes in AD patients receiving dupilumab or placebo, utilizing clinically relevant severity thresholds to describe no or low disease activity: the percentage of patients with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) <= 7 (mild or no disease), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) <= 5 (small or no effect on patient's life) and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) <= 7 (clear/almost clear skin or mild eczema) from baseline to Week 16 and Week 52 (CHRONOS). Data were derived from three randomized, placebo-controlled, double- blinded, phase III trials of dupilumab, in which patients with moderate-to-severe AD were given placebo weekly (qw), dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or dupilumab 300 mg qw for either 16 weeks (SOLO 1, NCT02277743; SOLO 2, NCT02277769) or 52 weeks (CHRONOS, NCT02260986). In CHRONOS, patients were administered concomitant topical corticosteroids. Data from SOLO 1 & 2 were pooled (SOLO). For all three endpoints, the treatment groups had balanced scores at baseline (dupilumab q2w/qw vs. placebo). A greater proportion of dupilumab-treated patients had EASI <= 7 at Week 16 (SOLO, 55.5%/60.6% vs. 21.0%; CHRONOS, 72.7%/71.9% vs. 37.0%) and Week 52 (CHRONOS, 71.7%/82.1% vs. 45.3%). A greater proportion of dupilumab-treated patients had DLQI <= 5 at Week 16 (SOLO, 67.3%/65.0% vs. 40.8%; CHRONOS, 79.8%/78.1% vs. 47.1%) and Week 52 (CHRONOS, 81.8%/79.0% vs. 51.5%).

LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 3 study (NCT02414854) evaluating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma. Method(s): Patients aged >=12 years with moderate-to-severe asthma uncontrolled with medium-tohigh dose inhaled corticosteroids and up to 2 additional controllers were randomized 2:1 to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab in 200 mg or 300 mg doses or matched placebos every 2 weeks (q2w) for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints of the study were annualized rate of severe exacerbation events over the 52-week treatment period and absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Result(s): In 1,902 randomized patients, dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg q2w significantly reduced annualized severe exacerbation rates vs matched placebos by 48% and 46%, respectively (both P<0.0001), and improved FEV1 at Week 12 (least-squares mean difference vs placebo 0.14/0.13 L for 200/300 mg; both P<0.0001) in the overall population.

"Type 2 biomarkers associated with dupilumab efficacy in patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma enrolled in the phase 3 study liberty asthma quest",,"Introduction: Dupilumab, a fully human IL-4R-alpha monoclonal antibody, inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 inflammation, is approved in the USA and the EU for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 asthma study (NCT02414854), adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe asthma, uncontrolled with medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controller medications, received add-on dupilumab 200 or 300mg every 2 weeks, or matched placebos, for 52 weeks. Dupilumab regimens vs matched placebos significantly reduced annualized severe exacerbation rates during the 52-week treatment period and significantly improved prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and % change in FEV1 at Week 12 in the intent-to-treat population. Dupilumab also improved asthma symptoms, quality of life measures, and was generally well tolerated. These post-hoc analyses evaluate associations between baseline type 2 inflammatory biomarkers with therapeutic responses to dupilumab. Method(s): Treatment-by-biomarker interactions between baseline levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and peripheral blood biomarkers (eosinophils, periostin, eosinophil cationic protein, total IgE, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine , and eotaxin-3) and both dupilumab regimens were determined using an un-penalized negative-binomial regression spline model for annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the treatment period and an un-penalized regression spline model for the absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12. Result(s): In 1,902 patients, for annualized rate of severe exacerbation events, significant treatment-by-baseline biomarker interactions were observed between eosinophils and FeNO with both dupilumab regimens (overall P<0.0001 for eosinophils; P<0.0001 for FeNO; Table). For the absolute change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12, significant treatment-bybaseline biomarker interactions were observed between eosinophils, FeNO, periostin, total IgE and eotaxin-3 for both dupilumab regimens (overall P<0.0001 for eosinophils and FeNO; P<0.0009 for periostin; P<0.0245 for total IgE; P<0.0151 for eotaxin-3; Table). The most frequent adverse event in the dupilumab-treated groups vs placebo was injection site reactions (15%/18% vs 5%/10%, respectively). In contrast to dupilumab studies in atopic dermatitis, conjunctivitis rates were similar between dupilumab and placebo. Conclusion(s): In patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma, multiple type 2 biomarkers, including eosinophils, FeNO, and periostin, showed significant treatment-by-baseline biomarker interactions for FEV1, while only blood eosinophils and FeNO showed treatment interaction for exacerbations. This suggests that differences in biologic pathways for lung function and exacerbations exist, but that blood eosinophils and FeNO are common to both and may be better biomarkers for treatment decisions.

A Phase IIb dose-ranging efficacy and safety study of tralokinumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD),,"Background/Objective: AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by increased interleukin (IL)-13 levels. Tralokinumab, an anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibody, has shown efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma driven by the T-helper 2 pathway. Serum dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) has been reported as a predictive marker for tralokinumab in patients with severe asthma. Here, we evaluated whether tralokinumab offers therapeutic benefit to adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Method(s): In this Phase IIb, randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind study (NCT02347176), patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive tralokinumab 45mg, 150mg, or 300mg, or placebo every two weeks with mid-strength topical corticosteroids (TCS) for 12 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) and percentage of patients with clear or almost clear Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA 0/1) at Week 12. Further efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, serum biomarkers, and safety endpoints were assessed. Result(s): Overall, 204 patients were randomized. Tralokinumab 300mg treatment significantly reduced EASI scores (adjusted mean [standard error] change from baseline: 15.7 [1.3]; p=0.011) vs. placebo (-10.8 [1.4]) and more patients had IGA 0/1 (26% vs. 12%). Significant improvements were observed in patients who received tralokinumab 300mg versus placebo for Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (p=0.002), Dermatology Life Quality Index (p=0.006), Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (p=0.002), EASI75 (p=0.003), and EASI50 (p=0.025). Tralokinumab 300mg significantly reduced the number of Staphylococcus aureus-colonized patients (p=0.015), the concentration of serum immunoglobulin E, periostin, and TARC/CCL17, dose-dependently versus placebo (p<0.001). Patients with increased IL-13 activity (n=102), identified by baseline serum DPP-4 concentrations above median, showed an increased response to tralokinumab 300mg; more patients achieved IGA 0/1 (35% vs. 8%) and EASI75 (52% vs. 13%) than patients receiving placebo. The most frequent adverse events in all groups were nasopharyngitis (17%), upper respiratory tract infection (9%), headache (6%) and AD (6%). Conclusion(s): Tralokinumab with TCS was more efficacious than TCS alone and demonstrated clinically relevant efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

Atopic comorbidities and biomarkers of type 2 inflammation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) who failed intranasal corticosteroids,,"RATIONALE: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is a type 2 inflammatory disease of nasal and paranasal sinuses often associated with other atopic/allergic diseases and a negative impact on health-related quality of life. To better understand the prevalence and association of atopic comorbidities and biomarkers of inflammation in a population with more severe CRSwNP, we conducted a post hoc analysis of baseline data acquired in a phase 2a study of dupilumab (NCT01920893). Dupilumab is approved by the US FDA for treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. METHOD(S): 60 adult CRSwNP patients refractory to intranasal corticosteroids were randomized (1:1) to 16 weeks of weekly subcutaneous 300 mg dupilumab or placebo, with daily mometasone furoate nasal spray. Comorbidities were evaluated by reviewing patient-reported medical histories at the screening visit along with baseline levels of inflammation biomarkers in the blood. RESULT(S): Most frequent comorbidities (>10%) were history of asthma (58.3%), allergic rhinitis (56.7%), aspirin and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity (31.7%), allergic conjunctivitis (28.3%), food allergy and/or intolerance (16.7%), hives (13.3%), and atopic dermatitis (11.7%). In patients with history of atopic disease (n=43/60), baseline type 2 biomarkers were numerically higher vs patients without (n=17/60) (mean blood eosinophils, 0.47 vs 0.31 Giga/L; thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, 483.20 vs 396.07 pg/mL; plasma eotaxin- 3, 65.54 vs 55.39 pg/mL; serum total IgE, 183.00 vs 125.36 IU/mL).

Psychometric validation of the atopic dermatitis impact questionnaire (ADIQ),,"OBJECTIVES: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with substantial impairment of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). A new instrument, the AD Impact Questionnaire (ADIQ), was developed following FDA PRO Guidance (2009) to assess impact of AD on patients' lives. The ADIQ was included in a Ph2 clinical trial and data from that trial was used to assess measurement properties. METHOD(S): In a Ph2 clinical trial 209 patients aged 18-75y with moderate-to-severe AD (after initial screening and a 2-week topical corticosteroid [TCS] run-in period), were randomized to receive lebrikizumab 125mg Q4W, 250mg single dose (SD), 125mg SD, or placebo (PBO) plus twice-daily medium-potency TCS to all lesional skin for 12 weeks. Secondary analyses of screening, run-in, and Week 12 data, were used to evaluate item-levelstatistics, scalingstructure, reliabilityand validity. Data from all arms were pooled to assess measurement properties of the ADIQ. Data from patients with stable disease, i.e. less than a meaningful change (6.6pts) on the Eczema Disease Severity Index (EASI), was used for analyses with multiple time-points, e.g. test-retest. RESULT(S): 203 (97%) patients completed the ADIQ at screening. It showed evidence of adequate reliability (a=0.76); reproducibility (ICC = 0.95); and validity, with the latter including moderate correlations with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; r=0.84), and patient-reported components of SCORing Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD; r=0.41 (pruritus) and 0.46 (sleep loss)] at screening. Concurrent correlation between the ADIQ and indices of disease severity, [overall SCORAD, EASI and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)] was relatively low. However, change in ADIQ from screening to Week 12 readily detected minimal important differences in disease severity over the same time period, with SCORAD, EASI and IGA concordance indices ranging from 0.76 to 0.81.

This study assessed efficacy and safety of DPL in adults with moderate-to-severe EO. Aims & Methods: This double-blind, parallel, placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 2 study (NCT02379052) randomised adults (1:1) with active EO (histologically confirmed with dysphagia symptoms) to receive weekly subcutaneous DPL 300 mg (loading dose 600 mg, Day 1) or PBO for 12 weeks. Primary endpoint was change in Straumann Dysphagia Instrument (SDI) score from baseline (BL) to Week 10. Secondary endpoints included % change in weekly Eosinophilic Esophagitis Activity Index (EEsAI) score from BL to Week 10, % change in overall peak oesophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count (eos/hpf), change in a modified visual endoscopy score (EREFS) from BL to Week 12, and safety. Exploratory endpoints included change in Histological Scoring System (HSS)1 and oesophageal distensibility from BL to Week 12. Result(s): 47 pts (DPL n=23) received >=1 dose of study drug. BL demographics/characteristics were balanced between groups, except for mean total IgE (DPL 217.8 kU/L; PBO 468.2 kU/L).

Defining a responder on the peak pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: Detailed analysis from randomized trials of dupilumab,,"Rationale: To empirically derive estimates of responder definitions for the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), and to apply these to determine benefit of dupilumab on itch. Method(s): Responder definition estimates were computed using anchor- and distribution-based methods from a phase 2b randomized study of dupilumab (NCT01859988). The anchor-based analysis used the following anchors at Week (W) 16: 1-point improvement on the Pruritus Categorical Scale (PCS); patients achieving 50%-74%, 75%-89%, 90%-100% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) (EASI 50-74, EASI 75-89, EASI 90-100, respectively); patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of <=1 (IGA 0/1), or an IGA improvement of >=2 points. For the distribution-based method, one half-SD of the mean Peak Pruritus NRS score at baseline was used. Post-hoc cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of Peak Pruritus NRS at W2 and W16 were plotted for patients with moderate-to-severe AD receiving dupilumab 300 mg every week (qw) (n=462) or every other week (q2w) (n=457), or placebo (n=460) using data from two phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of dupilumab (SOLO 1: NCT02277743; SOLO 2: NCT02277769). Result(s): The responder definition estimate based on the patient-reported PCS was 2.6; estimates based on clinician-reported anchors (EASI and IGA) ranged from 2.2 to 4.2, with the highest estimates derived from the most stringent clinical criteria (EASI 90-100 and IGA 0/1). The one-half SD estimate was much lower at 0.76. In SOLO 1, the CDF plots showed clear separation between the two dupilumab groups and the placebo group across the full range of observed response thresholds (W2: -4 to 0; W16: -8 (dupilumab q2w)/ -7 (dupilumab qw) to 0). In SOLO 2, a similar separation was observed (W2: -5 to 0; W16: -7 to 0). Across both phase 3 trials, more dupilumab- vs placebo-treated patients were classified as responders at W2 and W16 using thresholds derived from the phase 2b study. Treatment groups had similar rates of treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) (SOLO 1: 65%-73%; SOLO 2: 65%-72%). Commonly-occurring TEAEs were AD exacerbations and injection-site reactions.

Correlations of itch with quality of life and signs of atopic dermatitis across dupilumab trials,,"Background: In phase 3 studies dupilumab improved signs and symptoms (including itch) of atopic dermatitis (AD), with an acceptable safety profile. We present the relationship between peak pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores. Method(s): This post-hoc correlation analysis presents data from three randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase 3 trials of dupilumab (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1: NCT02277743; LIBERTY AD SOLO 2: NCT02277769; LIBERTY AD CHRONOS: NCT02260986). Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1:1 (SOLO 1 and 2) or 3:1:3 (CHRONOS) to dupilumab 300 mg weekly/every two weeks, or placebo. In CHRONOS, all patients received background topical corticosteroids. Data from the SOLO 1 and 2 monotherapy studies were pooled. Result(s): All 2,119 randomized patients were included (SOLO 1 and 2: n=1,379/CHRONOS: n=740). Across all groups, baseline peak pruritus NRS scores correlated weakly with EASI (Pearson r SOLO 1 and 2: 0.2098/CHRONOS 0.2050) and moderately with DLQI scores (0.4855/0.4231). Stronger correlations of peak pruritus NRS scores with EASI (0.5642/0.4258) and DLQI (0.6242/0.5396) scores were observed for percent change from baseline to Week 16 and Week 52 (EASI: 0.3960, DLQI: 0.5647; CHRONOS only). Conclusion(s): Weak baseline correlation between peak pruritus NRS and EASI indicates that objective signs alone do not capture the full disease impact of moderate-to-severe AD. In dupilumab trials, post-treatment improvements in itch correlated well with improvements in EASI and DLQI, indicating that dupilumab had a comprehensive, balanced effect on AD signs, symptoms, and quality-of-life measures.",Yosipovitch G.; Eckert L.; Chen Z.; Ardeleanu M.; Shumel B.; Plaum S.; Graham N.; Pirozzi G.; Gadkari A.,,1534-4436,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&AN=619349036,
"Dupilumab improves patient-reported outcomes in atopic dermatitis patients inadequately controlled, intolerant, or inadvisable for cyclosporine-a",,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may require systemic therapy. Cyclosporine A (CsA) is approved for AD treatment in several countries. However, safety concerns limit its long-term use. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against IL-4 receptor a, inhibits signaling of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2/Th2 immune diseases such as AD. Method(s): CAF' (NCT02755649) was a 16-week, phase 3, doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adults with severe AD and prior history of intolerance or inadequate response to CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 (dupilumab 300mg weekly [qw]/every two weeks [q2w] or placebo); all received concomitant topical corticosteroid (TCS). Here, we report data for the US-approved q2w dosing regimen. Result(s): Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between placebo+TCS (n=108) and dupilumab q2w+TCS groups (n=107) (Table). Compared with placebo+TCS, dupilumab q2w+TCS significantly improved patient-reported itch, sleep, skin symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) as measured by the peak pruritus Numerical Rating Scale; Scoring Atopic Dermatitis visual analog scale for sleep loss; Patient-Oriented EczemaMeasure; and Dermatology Life Quality Index (Table). Most common adverse events included nasopharyngitis and allergic conjunctivitis (Table). Conclusion(s): In patients with a history of intolerance or inadequate response to CsA or for whom treatment with CsA is otherwise medically inadvisable, dupilumab and concomitant TCS, compared with TCS alone, significantly improved patientreported itch, sleep, skin symptoms, and QoL, with an acceptable safety profile (Table presented).",De Bruin-Weller M.; Gadkari A.; Simpson E.; Cork M.; Puig L.; Girolomoni G.; Wollenberg A.; Chen Z.; Radin A.; Shumel B.; Ardeleanu M.; Plaum S.; Eckert L.,,1534-4436,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed18&AN=619349020,
"Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adult patients with atopic dermatitis and a history of inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to cyclosporine: Subgroup analysis from a 1-year trial",,"Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may persist for decades requiring systemic therapy for extended periods of time. Cyclosporine (CsA) provides a rapid and broad immunosuppressive effect but its long-term use is limited due to safety concerns including hypertension and impaired renal and hepatic function. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin (IL)-4 receptor alpha, inhibits type 2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab was investigated in the phase 3 CHRONOS trial (NCT02260986). Objective(s): To compare the efficacy and safety of dupilumab vs placebo (PBO) at 52 weeks in two patient (pt) subsets of the CHRONOS population: pts who responded inadequately or were intolerant to CsA (subset A; n=114) and the remaining study population (subset B; n=509). CHRONOS was a 1-year, double-blind, randomized, PBO-controlled, parallel-group study in adults with moderate-to-severe AD and a history of inadequate response to topical corticosteroids (TCS). Pts were randomized 3:1:3 (dupilumab 300 mg weekly [qw], every two weeks [q2w], or PBO). Pts received a standardized regimen of concomitant low and/or medium potency TCS, which could be adjusted based on clinical response. Topical calcineurin inhibitors could be used in areas considered inadvisable for TCS. Result(s): Subset A pts had, on average, more severe disease than subset B pts, as assessed by Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) (mean baseline+/-SD EASI score 37.0+/-12.70 vs 31.6+/-12.77; nominal P<.0001 [post-hoc analysis]). At Week 52 in both subsets, dupilumab treatment increased the proportion of pts achieving a 75% improvement in EASI; and the proportion of pts achieving a >=4-point improvement in peak pruritus numerical rating scale (Table). Treatment groups had similar treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates (subset A: 88.9%, 90.9%/87.0%; subset B: 83.5%, 87.5%/ 82.2%). Most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, conjunctivitis, AD exacerbations, and injection site reaction. Similar efficacy and safety results (Table) were observed in a subset of pts that included both subset A pts plus pts who had been considered for CsA, based on AD severity, but had not received CsA treatment as it was contraindicated or inappropriate (subset C; n=126).

Biologicals for atopic dermatitis,,"In the past decennia systemic immunosuppressive treatment options in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) were limited. Oral immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine A (CsA), azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolic acid are used regularly, however a high a percentage of patients discontinue treatment due to inefficacy and/or side effects. In 2014 the first results of a phase 1 trial with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-4 receptor, in the treatment moderate to severe AD, were published. Dupilumab resulted in a rapid and a strong reduction of eczema an pruritus. An extensive phase 2 /3 dupilumab study was conducted, involving more than 2500 patients with moderate to severe AD. In 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials including 1379 patients with moderate-to-severe AD and inadequate response to topical medications, dupilumab monotherapy resulted in a 50[%] reduction of EASI score in 61-69[%] of the patients (placebo groups 22-25[%]); EASI 75 was reached in 44-52[%] in the dupilumab groups compared to 12-15[%] in the placebo groups.

METHOD(S): 380 adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 to 16-week treatment with subcutaneous placebo or dupilumab 100mg every 4 weeks (q4w), 300mg-q4w, 200mg every 2 weeks (q2w), 300mg-q2w, or 300mg weekly (NCT01859988). Assessments included PROs of Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D). RESULT(S): Mean age was 37 years; mean disease duration was 28 years. At 16 weeks, dupilumab significantly reduced itch on NRS (>3-point decrease) in 20% to 54% of patients vs. 8.2% in placebo group (P<0.0005 all doses except 100mg-q4w P<0.05), along with improvements in sleep on items of SCORAD and POEM measures (P<0.0005 all doses except 100mg-q4w). Dupilumab also significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety on HADS; number of patients with scores >11 indicating probable cases of anxiety or depression decreased by 66.7% to 75% in dupilumab groups vs. 22.2% in placebo group (P<0.05 all doses). Quality of life (QOL) improved at all dupilumab doses except 100mg-q4w (DLQI, P<0.0001; and EQ-5D, P<0.05). The most common adverse events (dupilumab doses combined vs. placebo) were nasopharyngitis (20.6% vs. 21.3%), headache (11.1% vs. 3.3%), and injection site reaction (9.5% vs. 3.3%). CONCLUSION(S): In adults with moderate-to-severe AD, dupilumab significantly reduced patient-reported itch relative to placebo, with concomitant improvements on PROs that evaluated sleep, mood, and QOL.",Simpson E.; Worm M.; Soong W.; Blauvelt A.; Eckert L.; Wu R.; Ardeleanu M.; Graham N.; Pirozzi G.; Sutherland E.R.; Mastey V.,,0091-6749,,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&AN=71789505,
"Dupilumab monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study",,"RATIONALE: Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-4Ra subunit, blocks IL-4/IL-13 signaling. METHOD(S): This European trial randomized adults with moderate-tosevere atopic dermatitis poorly controlled by topical agents to 12 weekly subcutaneous doses of placebo (n=54) or dupilumab 300 mg (n=55); topical agents were not permitted. Primary efficacy endpoint was percent change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in EASI, body surface area, SCORAD, pruritus numerical rating scale, and 5-D Pruritus Scale; proportions of patients achieving EASI reduction >=50% (EASI-50), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1, and safety were assessed. RESULT(S): Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (EASI mean +/-SD: 23.12+/-12.35 on dupilumab and 24.10+/-12.70 on placebo). Percent change from baseline in EASI showed improvements that significantly favored dupilumab relative to placebo, -74.0% and -23.3%, respectively (P<0.0001). EASI-50 responder rate was 85.5% with dupilumab and 35.2% with placebo (P<0.0001). Other measures of disease activity (SCORAD and IGA) and pruritus scores significantly favored dupilumab (P<0.0001). Eleven SAEs were reported in the placebo group compared to 1 in the dupilumab group. Skin infections were also reported less often in dupilumab group (2[4%] vs 14[26%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 74.5% with dupilumab and 77.8% with placebo. Frequent TEAEs reported more often with dupilumab were injection site reactions and nasopharyngitis. CONCLUSION(S): In this study, 12 weeks of dupilumab monotherapy was associated with rapid, marked improvements in measures of disease activity and pruritus, fewer SAEs, less infections compared to placebo, and was generally well-tolerated.",Bieber T.R.M.; Thaci D.; Graham N.; Pirozzi G.; Teper A.; Ren H.; Radin A.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.12.1068,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed15&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2013.12.1068,
Safety and efficacy of dupilumab versus placebo for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in patients using topical corticosteroids (TCS): Greater efficacy observed with concomitant therapy compared to TCS alone,,"RATIONALE: TCS are a key component of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment. We evaluated dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the IL-4 receptor alpha, administered concomitantly with TCS in adults with active moderate-to-severe AD (NCT01639040). METHOD(S): Patients were randomized to weekly subcutaneous injections of dupilumab 300mg (n=21) or placebo (PBO; n=10) for 4 weeks plus 8 weeks of follow-up. All patients used a standardized TCS regimen. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was the primary outcome. Exploratory efficacy endpoints evaluated through the treatment and follow-up periods included change in EASI, SCORAD, IGA, NRS pruritus scores, and EASI50 (>=50% improvement). RESULT(S): Thirty patients completed treatment with 41 TEAEs in 12 (57.1%) dupilumab patients and 14 TEAEs in 7 (70.0%) PBO patients; 1 serious TEAE occurred and led to treatment discontinuation (PBO patient). Most frequent TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (23.8% vs 20.0%; dupilumab vs PBO), headache, oropharyngeal pain (both 14.3% vs 10.0%). At Day 29, 100% of patients on dupilumab+TCS achieved EASI50 responses compared to 50% on PBO+TCS (p=0.0015). Significant improvements from baseline with dupilumab, relative to TCS alone, in EASI, IGA, SCORAD and pruritus NRS were achieved and persisted up to day 64. of note, patients on dupilumab used approximately 50% less TCS during the treatment period, mean(SD) 48.7g(40.3) vs 99.4g(152.5). This was associated with faster AD lesion clearing. CONCLUSION(S): Concomitant treatment with dupilumab+TCS was generally well tolerated. Relative to TCS alone, dupilumab+TCS provided marked, sustained, and significant improvement in clinical efficacy measures, despite use of less TCS.",Thaci D.; Worm M.; Ren H.; Weinstein S.; Graham N.; Pirozzi G.; Brooks W.; Ardeleanu M.,,0091-6749,/10.1016/j.jaci.2013.12.688,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed15&DO=10.1016%2fj.jaci.2013.12.688,
Treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with dupilumab (IL-4R MAb): Significant improvement in skin disease and pruritus,,"Objective: Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) often cannot be adequately controlled with topical agents. Current systemic treatments for AD carry risks of renal, hepatic, or hematologic toxicities with long-term use. Novel systemic therapeutics for AD are needed. Dupilumab (REGN668/SAR231893), a fully human mAb targeting IL-4Ralpha, potently inhibits both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling implicated in AD. Safety and efficacy of 4, weekly, SC doses of dupilumab in adults with AD were evaluated in two randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, phase 1b trials. Method(s): Pooled data from dupilumab-treated patients (75 mg, n = 8; 150 mg, n = 22; 300 mg, n = 21) were compared with placebo (n = 16). Patients were followed for a total of 16 weeks. Result(s): Mean (SD) baseline body surface area (BSA) was 51.4 (24.87), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score was 3.8 (0.62), Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) was 30.0 (14.19), and pruritus NRS score was 6.0 (1.72). Significant improvement was seen within 2 weeks with 300 mg dose in BSA (P < 0.02), IGA (P < 0.05), and EASI (P < 0.0001). At 4 weeks, significant improvements vs. placebo were achieved (150 and 300 mg doses) for change from baseline in BSA (P < 0.05), IGA (P < 0.001), EASI (P < 0.001) and pruritus NRS (P < 0.01, 300 mg). More patients had > or = 50% reduction in EASI score with dupilumab 150 mg (54.5%) and 300 mg (71.4%) vs. placebo (18.8%) at 4 weeks (P < 0.05 for both). The most common treatment-emergent AEs were nasopharyngitis (19.6% vs. 12.5% for placebo) and headache (11.8% vs. 6.3% for placebo). Conclusion(s): Dupilumab was well tolerated and effective in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. These results warrant further studies to better characterize this compound.",Simpson E.; Thaci D.; Beck L.; Rocklin R.; Pirozzi G.; Ren H.; Graham N.; Radin A.,,0954-7894,/10.1111/cea.12197,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&DO=10.1111%2fcea.12197,
Blocking IL-4Ralpha signaling with REGN668/SAR231893 rapidly suppresses major pathogenic pathways in severe atopic dermatitis,,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease. Existing therapies are limited, creating a large unmet medical need. Since the Th2 cytokines IL-4/IL-13 play a key role in AD, inhibition of these cytokines may provide an effective treatment. REGN668/SAR231893, a fully human monoclonal antibody against IL-4Ralpha chain, potently blocks IL-4/IL-13 signaling. We evaluated the effects of IL-4Ralpha blockade on the molecular skin pathology in patients with severe AD treated with REGN668/SAR231893 or placebo (PBO). Pre- and post-treatment lesional skin biopsies were obtained from 18 consenting patients who participated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 4 subcutaneous weekly injections of 75, 150, 300mg REGN668/SAR231893 or PBO. Significant dose-dependent changes from baseline gene expression were detected by RT-PCR and microarrays at week 4. Improvements of 52% and 25% in an established AD transcriptome (defining the gene expression differences between lesional and nonlesional AD phenotypes) were observed in the 300mg and 150mg doses respectively, paralleling significant decreases in the respective EASI scores, versus a 25% worsening in the PBO group. 894 probes were significantly modulated in the higher-dose group (fold change>2, p<0.05). Significant decreases in the mRNA expression of genes related to hyperplasia (K16, MKi67), T- and dendritic cells (Granzyme B, CD1b, CD1c) and potent inhibition of Th2-associated chemokines (CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, and CCL26) were noted without significant modulation of Th1-associated IFNgamma, IL- 17 and IL-22. This is the first report of a targeted biologic therapy in AD showing clinical and molecular disease suppression, achieved after only 4 weeks of IL-4Ralpha blockade. These data suggest IL-4/IL-13 as the major pathogenic cytokines in AD that drive a complex Th2-centered inflammatory axis in this disease.",Hamilton J.D.; Suarez-Farinas M.; Kostic A.; Ming J.; Dhingra N.; Radin A.; Krueger J.; Guttman-Yassky E.,,0022-202X,/10.1038/jid.2013.102,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&DO=10.1038%2fjid.2013.102,
Biomarkers elevated in atopic dermatitis (AD) are reduced by therapeutic blockade of IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) signaling with REGN668/SAR231893 in patients with severe AD,,"REGN668/SAR231893, a fully human monoclonal antibody against IL-4Ralpha chain that potently blocks both IL-4 and IL-13 signaling thus inhibiting the T-helper 2 (Th2) immune pathway, which is implicated as a key driver of atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. Analyses of serum levels of the Th2 markers thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and total immunoglobulin E (IgE), as well as serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), all of which are associated with AD severity, were performed centrally on samples collected in a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial (NCT01385657) of weekly subcutaneous doses of REGN668/SAR231893 (150mg and 300mg) or PBO for 4 weeks (last dose day 21, plus 8 weeks follow-up) in 37 adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. A rapid reduction (median >70% from baseline) in TARC was observed in patients treated with 300mg REGN668/SAR231893 compared with PBO (p<0.0001), with suppression maintained for approximately 1 month after the last dose. The serum IgE median % change from baseline was significantly different from PBO as early as day 15 (300mg, p=0.0379), and continued to be significant through the end of the study (day 85), when it was -23.9% with 300mg REGN668/SAR231893 relative to a 41.7% increase with PBO (p<0.0001). REGN668/SAR231893 treatment was also associated with a statistically significant decrease from baseline in LDH (median reduction >12% at day 29 with 300mg REGN668/SAR231893 compared to a median 2.6% increase in the PBO group; p=0.0051). The most common adverse event was nasopharyngitis (n=9 [33%] vs. 2 [20%] for PBO). These results show that the IL-4Ralpha inhibitor REGN668/SAR231893 significantly suppressed serum biomarkers (TARC, IgE, LDH) associated with Th2 inflammation and/or disease activity in adult AD patients.",Hamilton J.D.; Beck L.A.; Ren H.; Simpson E.; Kostic A.; Ming J.; Chaudhry U.; Graham N.; Radin A.,,0022-202X,/10.1038/jid.2013.102,,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&DO=10.1038%2fjid.2013.102,

"Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exposure-efficacy of dupilumab in adults with atopic dermatitis.",2022 10,"The pharmacokinetics (PKs) and exposure-efficacy of dupilumab have not been fully described for adults with atopic dermatitis (AD). Our objectives were to analyze the PKs and exposure-efficacy of dupilumab in adults with AD and compare the results of Japanese and overall populations. Adults with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned to dupilumab (300 mg weekly [qw] or every 2 weeks [q2w], 200 mg q2w, 300 mg every 4 weeks [q4w], or 100 mg q4w) or placebo for 16 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase IIb trial (NCT01859988). This analysis included 379 patients (58 Japanese). Functional dupilumab concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner; at lower concentrations, increases were greater than dose-proportional because of nonlinear, target-mediated clearance. Dupilumab pharmacokinetics were comparable in Japanese and non-Japanese patients with similar body weights. Week 16 efficacy parameters, including Investigator's Global Assessment score 0/1, greater than or equal to 75% reduction from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), and percentage change from baseline in EASI and pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, generally increased with week 16 trough concentration; the plateau of these exposure-efficacy relationships occurred for most patients at exposures associated with the 300 mg q2w and 300 mg qw regimens. Japanese ethnicity did not remain in the population PK model as covariate with or without accounting for body weight differences. In Japanese and non-Japanese patients, efficacy responses increased with week 16 dupilumab trough concentrations in a similar manner. Dupilumab 300 mg qw and q2w regimens were recommended for further evaluation in larger phase III studies. Copyright © 2022 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Sanofi and The Authors.

A study into the drug dupilumab in Japanese adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.,2020 07,"Atopic dermatitis (AD), a long-lasting skin disease characterized by intense itching and dry, red, swollen and cracked skin, affects between 2% and 10% of Japanese adults. In Japan, patients with moderate-to-severe or very severe AD have limited treatment options, most with unwanted side effects. There is a need for therapies that provide safe and effective long-term control. The underlying mechanism of AD may differ between Asian and Western patients, and this study aimed to evaluate dupilumab, a drug that blocks key molecules that cause AD, in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The authors studied Japanese patients from three international, placebo-controlled clinical trials of dupilumab. Of the 1,597 adults with moderate-to-severe AD in those trials (""all patients""), 250 were Japanese. The investigators measured the effects of dupilumab treatment for 16 weeks or one year on the signs (what a clinician observes) and symptoms (what a patient feels) of AD. At the start of each trial, Japanese patients generally had more severe AD than all patients. Nevertheless, dupilumab significantly improved signs and symptoms of AD (including itch) compared with placebo (dummy drug) in the Japanese patients and was as well tolerated in the Japanese patients as in all patients; dupilumab was more likely than placebo to be associated with injection-site reaction or conjunctivitis (""pinkeye""). Compared with placebo, dupilumab reduced the amount of substances in the blood that are generally increased in patients with AD. The investigators concluded that, similar to all patients, dupilumab is effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

"Efficacy of Dupilumab in Different Racial Subgroups of Adults With Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis in Three Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Trials.",2019 Aug 01,"Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor subunit for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, is currently approved for the treatment of adults with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The efficacy and safety of dupilumab for AD among racial subgroups is unknown. This post hoc analysis from three phase 3 trials assessed the efficacy and safety of dupilumab vs placebo by racial subgroup (White, Asian, Black/African American). Data from LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 (NCT02277743), SOLO 2 (NCT02277769), and CHRONOS (NCT02260986) were pooled. Outcomes included mean and percent change from baseline to week 16 in the key therapeutic domains Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, as well as Investigator's Global Assessment and pain or discomfort assessed by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions 3 level questionnaire. A total of 2,058 patients (White n=1,429, Asian n=501, Black/African American n=128) were included in the current analysis. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment groups and racial subgroups. In the three trials, dupilumab significantly (P<0.0001) improved all assessed outcomes compared with placebo in the White and Asian subgroups. In the smaller Black/African American subgroup, dupilumab significantly (P<0.0001) improved EASI endpoints and mean changes in Peak Pruritus NRS and DLQI vs placebo, with positive numeric trends favoring dupilumab in all other endpoints. Dupilumab was generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile in all racial subgroups. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently with placebo; treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were rare in all treatment groups. Significant clinical improvement and a favorable benefit-risk profile can be achieved with dupilumab treatment in patients of White, Asian, and Black/African American racial subgroups with moderate-to-severe AD inadequately controlled with topical medications.
